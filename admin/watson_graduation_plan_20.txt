Planned Graduation Date: Fall 2020

Research Summary: Platelet interactions with the blood vessel wall are an 
important first step in the formation of a blood clot. These contacts are 
responsible for activating platelets to release chemical signals to other blood 
cells and proteins to begin to clot. In collaboration with an experimental 
group on campus, I am modeling the physical and chemical dynamics involved in 
these contacts. The goal is to estimate the distribution of platelet velocities 
as they contact the surface, and verify model results with the experimental 
results from our collaborators. 

Research Schedule:

   Spring 2020
      - Teaching
		- Finish analyzing the 4 state jump-velocity model, fitting model parameters to experimental data
		- Develop 3D ellipsoidal rolling model w/ fast and slow receptors
		- Continue writing dissertation (Intro/Lit Review, Chapter 2, begin Chapter 3)
   
	Summer 2020
      - Teaching
      - Analyze the effect of priming (i.e. increase in slow receptor density) on observed rolling behavior in the 3D model
      - Continue writing dissertation (Finish chapter 3, Begin chapter 4)
   
	Fall 2020
		- Teaching
      - Thesis defense (early in the semester)
      - Apply for jobs
		- Finish writing and submit dissertation (Finish chapter 5 and discussion)
