Research Summary: Platelet interactions with the blood vessel wall are an 
important first step in the formation of a blood clot. These contacts are 
responsible for activating platelets to release chemical signals to other blood 
cells and proteins to begin to clot. In collaboration with an experimental 
group on campus, I am modeling the physical and chemical dynamics involved in 
these contacts. The goal is to estimate the distribution of platelet velocities 
as they contact the surface, and verify model results with the experimental 
results from our collaborators. 

Research Schedule:

   Spring 2019
      - Pass Oral Exam (tentatively scheduled for March)
      - Extend rolling model to 3D
      - Find realistic parameter values and compare with data from collaborators
   Summer 2019
      - Teaching
      - Add multiple receptors to rolling model
   Fall 2019 and Spring 2020
      - Teaching
      - Include intracellular dynamics (can be as simple or as complex as 
        necessary, depending on the experimental data)
      - Compare with experimental results on velocity distributions, pause 
        times/distance between pauses
      - Prepare dissertation
      - Applying for jobs (Spring)
   Summer 2020
      - Thesis defense
      - Applying for jobs
