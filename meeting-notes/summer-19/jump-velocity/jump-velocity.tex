  {\Large Notes on a Jump-Velocity Model of Platelet Rolling (\today)}
\end{center}

\section{Description of the Jump-Velocity Model}
\label{sec:jump-vel}

Suppose we model platelets as particles in a moving fluid. Assume that
unprimed platelets can exist in two states: unbound (U), and bound to
vWF (V) (Figure \ref{fig:unprimed-states}). Platelets in the unbound
state advect at velocity $v$ in the fluid, and platelets in the
vWF-bound state are stationary. Platelets in the fluid can bind to vWF
at a constant rate $k_\tn{on}$, and platelets bound to vWF can come
unbound at constant rate $k_\tn{off}$.

\emph{Modification}: We can split the U state into platelets that have
not bound to the surface (call these U\textsuperscript{0} platelets)
and those that have bound to a surface and then unbound
(U\textsuperscript{1} platelets).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{unprimed-states.png}
  \caption[Possible states of unprimed platelets]{An unprimed platelet
    can exist in three distinct states: (U\textsuperscript{0})
    platelets which haven't interacted with the surface,
    (U\textsuperscript{0}) platelets which have interacted with the
    surface and are advecting in the fluid, or (V) bound to vWF on the
    surface and unmoving. Transitions between these states occur at
    constant rates $k_\tn{on}$ and $k_\tn{off}$. Platelets can only
    transition out of the U\textsuperscript{0} state.}
  \label{fig:unprimed-states}
\end{figure}

For primed platelets, assume that they can exist in 4 possible states:
unbound (U), vWF-bound (V), fibrinogen-bound (F), and vWF- and
fibrinogen-bound (VF) (Figure \ref{fig:primed-states}). The U and V
states are the same as for the unprimed platelets, however in addition
both the U and V states can bind with fibrinogen to transition to the
F and VF states. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{primed-states.png}
  \caption[Possible states of primed platelets]{A primed platelet can
    exist in five states: (U) unbound from the surface and advecting
    in the fluid (further split into the two categories defined
    above), (V) bound to vWF on the surface, (F) bound to fibrinogen
    on the surface, or (VF) bound to both vWF and fibrinogen. In all
    three bound states, the platelet is immobilized on the surface.}
  \label{fig:primed-states}
\end{figure}

These models describe a jump-velocity process, where a particle is
transitioning randomly between discrete states, which each move with a
different deterministic motion. The Fokker-Planck equation for these
processes are given by the following system of linear advection
equations:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fp-system}
  \Pder{}{t}
  \underbrace{
    \begin{pmatrix}
      p_{\tn{U}^0} \\ p_{\tn{U}^1} \\ p_\tn{V} \\ p_\tn{F} \\ p_\tn{VF}
    \end{pmatrix}}_{\equiv \mathbf{p}}
  =
  -\Pder{}{x}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    v p_{\tn{U}^0} \\ v p_{\tn{U}^0} \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  +
  \underbrace{
    \begin{pmatrix}
      -(k_\tn{on} + k_\tn{on}^F) & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & -(k_\tn{on} + k_\tn{on}^F) & k_\tn{off} & k_\tn{off}^F & 0 \\
      k_\tn{on} & k_\tn{on} & -(k_\tn{off} + k_\tn{on}^F) & 0 & k_\tn{off}^F \\
      k_\tn{on}^F & k_\tn{on}^F & 0 & -(k_\tn{on} + k_\tn{off}^F) & k_\tn{off} \\
      0 & 0 & k_\tn{on}^F & k_\tn{on} & -(k_\tn{off} + k_\tn{off}^F)
  \end{pmatrix}}_{\equiv A}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{\tn{U}^0} \\ p_{\tn{U}^1} \\ p_\tn{V} \\ p_\tn{F} \\ p_\tn{VF}
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $p_i = p_i(x, t \mid x_0, j, 0)$ is the probability the platelet
is in state $i$ and position $x$ at time $t$ given it was previously
in position $z$ and state $j$ at time $0$. If the platelets are
unprimed, then the only difference is $k_\tn{on}^F = k_\tn{off}^F =
0$.

The goal is to find the probability density function of the average
velocity across a segment of length $L$, so take the initial condition
of the PDE system (\ref{eq:fp-system}) to be
$\mathbf{p}(x, 0) = (\delta(x), 0, 0, 0, 0)^T$. That is, all platelets
enter in never-bound state U\textsuperscript{0}. The probability
density of the time it takes a platelet to cross the interval $[0, L]$
is $v(p_{\tn{U}^0}(L, t) + p_{\tn{U}^1}(L,t))$. The average velocity
associated with a crossing time $t^*$ is just $v^* = L/t^*$, and the
probability density function of $v^*$ is given by
$f(v^*) = (L/v^*)^2 p_U(L, L/v^*)$

\subsection{Nondimensionalization}
\label{sec:nondim}

Define the nondimensional variables $s$ and $y$ so that $t = Ts$ and
$x = Xy$. Let's scale $x$ by the domain length, so $X = L$, and scale
$t$ by the velocity, so that $X/T = v \implies T = L/v$. That is, $T$
is the shortest possible crossing time of a
platelet. Finally---motivated by the adiabatic reduction in example
3.6.1 in Dr. Keener's notes---define the nondimensional parameter
$\epsilon_1 = 1/(T(k_\tn{on} + k_\tn{off}))$ and
$\epsilon_2 = 1/(T(k_\tn{on}^F + k_\tn{off}^F))$. If the sum of the
(relevant) reaction rates is much larger than $1/T$, then $\epsilon$
is a small parameter. After the nondimensionalization, equation
(\ref{eq:fp-system}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nd-system}
  \Pder{\mathbf{q}}{s} = -\Pder{}{y}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    q_{\tn{U}^0} \\ q_{\tn{U}^1} \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  + \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_2}\right)
  \begin{pmatrix}
    - kb - kd & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & - kb - kd & ka & kc & 0 \\
    kb & kb & - ka - kd & 0 & kc \\
    kd & kd & 0 & - kb - kc & ka \\
    0 & 0 & kd & kb & - ka - kc
  \end{pmatrix}
  \mathbf{q},
\end{equation}
where $a = k_\tn{off}/(k_\tn{off} + k_\tn{on})$,
$b = k_\tn{on}/(k_\tn{off} + k_\tn{on})$,
$c = k_\tn{off}^F/(k_\tn{off}^F + k_\tn{on}^F)$, and
$d = k_\tn{on}^F/(k_\tn{off}^F + k_\tn{on}^F)$. Then
$ka = a/(1 + \epsilon_1/\epsilon_2)$,
$kb = b/(1 + \epsilon_1/\epsilon_2)$,
$kc = c/(1 + \epsilon_2/\epsilon_1)$, and
$kd = d/(1 + \epsilon_2/\epsilon_1)$. When
$k_\tn{on}^F = k_\tn{off}^F = 0$, this reduces to the example in
Dr. Keener's notes.

\section{Numerics and results for unprimed platelets}
\label{sec:res-unpr}

The system of equations for unprimed platelets reduces to
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:unprimed-1}
  \Pder{q_\tn{U}}{s} &= -\Pder{q_\tn{U}}{y} - \frac{1}{\epsilon}
                       \left(b q_\tn{U} + a q_\tn{V}\right) \\
  \label{eq:unprimed-2}
  \Pder{q_\tn{V}}{s} &= \frac{1}{\epsilon} \left(b q_\tn{U} - a
                       q_\tn{V}\right).
\end{align}

I use a first order upwind scheme to solve this system. The nodes of
the mesh are given by $y_i = ih$ for $i = 0, \hdots, N$ where
$h = 1/N$ and $s_j = jk$ for $j = 0, \hdots, M$ where $k =
s_\tn{max}/M$. In practice, I take $h = k$ so that the upwind scheme
can solve the advection part exactly.
% This results in the
% semi-discretized system
% \begin{align}
%   \Der{q_\tn{U}^i}{s} &= \frac{1}{h} \left(q_\tn{U}^{i-1} - q_\tn{U}^i
%                         \right) + \frac{1}{\epsilon} \left(-b
%                         q_\tn{U}^i + a q_\tn{V}^i \right) \quad
%                         \tn{for} \quad i = 1, \hdots, N
%   \\
%   \Der{q_\tn{V}^i}{s} &= \frac{1}{\epsilon} \left(b q_\tn{U}^i - a
%                         q_\tn{V}^i \right) \quad \tn{for} \quad i = 1,
%                         \hdots, N
% \end{align}
% which I solve with SciPy's implementation of the RK45 scheme.

The initial condition $q_{\tn{U}^0}(y, 0) = \delta(y)$ must be
approximated, so I use Peskin's approximate $\delta$-function
\cite{Peskin2002}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:delta-h}
  \delta_h(y) =
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{4h} \left( 1 + \cos\left(\frac{\pi y}{2h}\right) \right)
    & \tn{if} \quad \left|\frac{y}{2h}\right| \le 1 \\
    0 & \tn{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Therefore $q_\tn{U}^i(0) = \delta_h(y_i)$ and $q_\tn{V}^i(0) =
0$. Half of $\delta_h$ is outside of the domain, so the other half
must be advected into the domain as an inflow boundary condition:
$q_\tn{U}^0(s) = \delta_h(-s)$.

Because $a + b = 1$, there are only 2 nondimensional parameters to
choose: $\epsilon$ and $a$. The parameter $\epsilon$ gives the ratio
of the minimum crossing time to a characteristic reaction time, and
$a$ gives the ratio of $k_\tn{off}$ to the sum of reaction
rates. Below are some sample results for average velocity
distributions $f(v^*) = 1/{v^*}^2 q_U^N(1/v^*)$.

Observations:
\begin{itemize}
\item There is some nonzero probability mass that a platelet crosses
  the domain without ever binding. Specifically, this probability is
  $\exp(-b/\epsilon)$. Therefore the exact probability density
  function will have a $\delta$-function like spike at $v^* = 1$ that
  integrates to $\exp(-b/\epsilon)$.
\item As the off rate $a$ increases, the distribution of average
  velocities shifts to the right, as expected.
\end{itemize}

\section{Adiabatic reduction}
\label{sec:adb-red}

The adiabatic reduction is solved in example 3.6.1 of Dr. Keener's
stochastics notes. Starting with equations (\ref{eq:unprimed-1}) and
(\ref{eq:unprimed-2}), assume that $\epsilon \ll 1$ and define $v =
q_\tn{U} + q_\tn{V}$ to be the slow variable and $w = b q_\tn{U} - a
q_\tn{V}$ to be the fast variable. Then $v$ evolves as an
advection-diffusion equation:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:v}
  \Pder{v}{s} = -a \Pder{v}{y} + \epsilon a b \frac{\partial^2
    v}{\partial y^2}
\end{equation}
and $w$ satisfies the equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:w}
  w = -\epsilon a b \Pder{v}{y}.
\end{equation}

With the initial condition $v(y, 0) = \delta(y)$, equation
(\ref{eq:v}) can be solved analytically:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:v-soln}
  v(y, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi \epsilon a b t}} \exp \left[ \frac{-(y
      - at)^2}{4 \epsilon a b t} \right],
\end{equation}
and then using equation (\ref{eq:w}) to find $w$,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:w-soln}
  w(y, t) = \frac{y - at}{4t\sqrt{\pi \epsilon a b t}} \exp \left[ \frac{-(y
      - at)^2}{4 \epsilon a b t} \right].
\end{equation}

Then reversing the change of variables, $q_\tn{U} = av + w$ and
$q_\tn{V} = bv - w$, resulting in the following solutions for
$q_\tn{U}$ and $q_\tn{V}$:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:qu-soln}
  q_\tn{U} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi \epsilon a b t}} \left(a + \frac{y
             - at}{2t} \right) \exp \left[ \frac{-(y - at)^2}{4
             \epsilon a b t} \right], \\
  \label{eq:qv-soln}
  q_\tn{V} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi \epsilon a b t}} \left(b - \frac{y
             - at}{2t} \right) \exp \left[ \frac{-(y - at)^2}{4
             \epsilon a b t} \right].
\end{align}

The probability density function of the average velocity is then
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vel-dens}
  f(v^*) = (v^*)^{-2} q_\tn{U}(1, 1/v^*) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4 \pi
      \epsilon a b (v^*)^3}}
  \left(a + \frac{v^* - a}{2} \right) \exp\left[ \frac{-(v^* -
      a)^2}{4\epsilon a b v^*} \right].
\end{equation}

\section{Parameter Estimation}
\label{sec:parameter-estimation}

Chapter 15 from \textit{Numerical Recipes in Fortran} describes
methods for fitting proposed models to data. In the situation they
describe, data is collected at several values of some independent
variable (say $x$) with some measurement error $\sigma$ that may vary
with $x$, and the goal is to fit a deterministic model to that
data. They develop a maximum-likelihood estimate for model parameters
based on the data collected $(x_i, y_i)$ and measurement errors
$\sigma_i$. 

In our jump-velocity model, the situation is a little different. We
have a stochastic model of a jump-velocity process, which is used to
derive a Fokker-Planck equation for platelet position as a function of
time. From the Fokker-Planck equation we derive a probability
distribution for the average velocity of a platelet rolling across
some domain. Basically the average velocity of a platelet (or
equivalently, the time it takes a platelet to cross) is a random
variable. The Fokker-Planck equation defines a probability
distribution for this random variable as a function of model
parameters, and the data Vlado's group are collecting on average
velocity are realizations of this random variable. Then we want to fit
the probability distribution defined by model parameters to the
realizations collected by Vlado's group.

One way to fit the model to average velocity data is to use a
maximum-likelihood estimate. This is analogous to the procedure
described in Chapter 15 of \textit{Numerical Recipes}. Let
$\{v_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of observations of average velocities, and
define $f(v;a, \epsilon)$ to be the probability distribution of
velocities given parameters $a$ and $\epsilon$ (for simplicity, assume
we're working with the two-state model). Define the likelihood
function
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:likelihood}
  L(a, \epsilon) = \prod_{i=1}^N f(v_i; a, \epsilon),
\end{equation}
and then the maximum likelihood estimates for $a$ and $\epsilon$ are
``simply'' those that maximize $L$. As usual, define the
log-likelihood function: $\tilde{\ell}(a, \epsilon) = \log(L(a, \epsilon))$,
and then maximizing $\tilde{\ell}$ is equivalent to maximizing $L$.

We found $f(v; a, \epsilon)$ above in terms of the solution of the
Fokker-Planck equation: $f(v; a, \epsilon) = 1/v^2 q_{U^1}(1, 1/v; a,
\epsilon)$ where $q_{U^1}(x, t; a, \epsilon)$ is part of the solution
of the Fokker-Planck equation with parameters $a$ and $\epsilon$. Then
we can write $\tilde{\ell}$ in terms of $q_{U^1}$:
$\tilde{\ell} = \sum_{i=1}^N \log(f(v_i; a, \epsilon)) = \sum_{i=1}^N
\log(q_{U^1}(1, 1/v_i; a, \epsilon)) - 2\sum_{i=1}^N \log(v_i)$. The
second term is a constant factor with respect to $a$ and $\epsilon$,
and so can be excluded from the optimization. Therefore we can
maximize the modified log-likelihood function
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mod-log-like}
  \ell(a, \epsilon) = \sum_{i=1}^N \log(q_{U^1}(1, 1/v_i; a, \epsilon)).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Numerical Optimization}
\label{sec:numer-optim}

Clearly $\ell(a, \epsilon)$ must be maximized iteratively. We haven't
even found an analytical expression for $q_{U^1}$. Unless we do, the
Fokker-Planck equation must be re-solved each time the parameters $a$
and $\epsilon$ are changed. Fortunately the PDE only needs to be
solved once for each evaluation of $\ell(a, \epsilon)$. We have to
find $q_{U^1}(1, t)$ up to time $t = 1/\min(v_i)$, but then to
evaluate the probability density at each time $1/v_i$, we only need to
interpolate the solution.

Another important consideration is that the model parameters $a$ and
$\epsilon$ have bounds, in particular $a \in (0, 1)$ and
$\epsilon > 0$. One option to deal with this is to choose a numerical
method that optimizes within a bounded domain, however when I tried
this the optimization function I was using ran into overflow errors
when it got too close to the edge of the domain. Restricting the
parameters to even tighter domains fixed this problem, but the bounds
were chosen arbitrarily, and with prior knowledge of the true
parameters of the ``data''. I have achieved good results in my
experiments by transforming the model parameters $a$ and $\epsilon$ to
``fitting'' parameters $a'$ and $\epsilon'$ which can vary over all
$\R$. The transformations I have chosen are:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:a-fwd-trns}
  a' &= \frac{2a + 1}{2a(a + 1)} \\
  \label{eq:e-fwd-trns}
  \epsilon' &= \log \epsilon.
\end{align}
$a'$ is defined so that $a'=0$ at $a=1/2$, $a' \rightarrow -\infty$ as
$a \rightarrow 0$, and $a' \rightarrow \infty$ as $a \rightarrow
1$. With the fitting parameters, the optimization problem becomes an
unconstrained optimization in $\R^2$. To actually carry out the
optimization I use SciPy's \verb|minimize| function, which implements
the BFGS algorithm.

An iterative algorithm needs an intial guess, which at least in the
two-state model, can be chosen as an estimate of $a$ and $\epsilon$
from the adiabatic reduction. Equation (\ref{eq:vel-dens}) gives the
pdf of velocities from the adiabatic reduction, and can be used to
derive the mean $\mu(a, \epsilon)$ and variance $\sigma^2(a,
\epsilon)$ as functions of $a$ and $\epsilon$. These moments actually
have simple analytical expressions (according to Mathematica):
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:mean-ar}
  \mu(a, \epsilon) &= a(1 + \epsilon - a \epsilon) \\
  \label{eq:var-ar}
  \sigma^2(a, \epsilon) &= a^2 \epsilon (1 - a) (2 + 5(1 - a) \epsilon).
\end{align}

Then we can equate $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ to the first two sample
moments ($\bar{v}$ and $s^2$) of the data to estimate $a$ and
$\epsilon$ (this is called the method of moments). $a$ and $\epsilon$
can be expressed in terms of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ analytically, but
the formulas are messy. Note that $\sigma^2 = O(\epsilon)$ and
$\epsilon << 1$, so we can use an asymptotic approximation instead of
the full formulas. The estimate is only being used to initialize the
optimization algorithm, so there is no need to be exact. Therefore up
to $O(\sigma^2)$, the method of moments gives the following estimates
for $a$ and $\epsilon$ based on a data set with sample mean $\bar{v}$
and sample variance $s^2$:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:mean-est}
  a &= \bar{v} - \frac{s^2}{2\bar{v}} \\
  \label{eq:var-est}
  \epsilon &= \frac{s^2}{2(1 - \bar{v})(\bar{v})^2}.
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Numerical experiments}
\label{sec:numer-exper}

\subsection{Bootstrapping}
\label{sec:bootstrapping}

The maximum likelihood estimator only gives a point estimate of the
parameters $a$ and $\epsilon$. In order to get confidence intervals,
we can use a bootstrapping approach. The basic idea is that for a set
of data $\{V_i\}_{i=1}^N$, a ``new'' data set can be generated by
randomly picking $N$ samples from the $\{V_i\}$ with replacement. Then
the MLE for the new data can be found, and in this way we get a bunch
of $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{\epsilon}$ estimates. After generating many of
these estimates, we can come up with an estimate of a 95\% confidence
interval for each parameter. If we assume that the ML estimates are
distributed sufficiently normally, then
$\hat{\theta} \pm 1.96 \sigma_{\hat{\theta}}$ approximates a 95\%
confidence interval well. But it seems like using the $2.5$th and
$97.5$th percentiles also provides a good estimate for the confidence
interval, and doesn't rely on assuming the parameter estimate is
distributed normally.
