## The ten questions

1. What is the problem? (in the theoretical debate, the world)
A major difficulty in biomedical engineering is the development of materials which are compatible with blood. In order to understand how to engineer better materials, we must first have a good understanding of how platelets interact with blood vessels, and specifically agonists in the blood. We want to develop a model to describe the biophysical and chemical interactions involved in initial platelet contacts with an agonist-coated surface and platelet activation.
2. Who cares? (an argument about its importance)
A model which characterizes platelet contacts with a surface is useful in predicting which biological parameters are most important in facilitating platelet rolling and activation, and will inform experimental setups to test model predictions.
3. What have others done? (the lit review, but pointed as an argument)
Models of rolling have been developed primarily for leukocytes, as well as for platelets to a lesser extent. These models tend to be either very detailed and computationally expensive, or highly idealized. Most of them do not include any intracellular signaling which can change the rolling behavior of the cells.
4. What is your approach? (your general approach, the new idea)
Our model exists somewhere between the detailed adhesive dynamics models and the simple idealized models.
5. What are you going to do explicitly? (your operationalization, investigation)
We model individual and spatially-varying bonds, but do not track individual receptors, and simplify forces and geometry to run faster simulations. This will allow us to include signaling dynamics which change the rolling behavior of the platelet, without making the model intractable. Ultimately, I would like to include platelet traversal of a priming flow chamber.
6. What will happen? (or did happen, if you have results)
In current results, our model shows that rolling is facilitated by a small number of bonds, and stochasticity plays an important role in rolling. Our model is also able to reproduce similar features to preliminary experimental results (in particular the bimodal distribution of primed platelets). In the future, we should see greater platelet adhesion to the capture region and slower rolling by primed platelets.
7. What does this mean? (in terms of answering the problem)
From the model, we should be able to extract the relative importance of different parameters to platelet rolling and activation (i.e. parameter sensitivity).
8. Who cares? (in what way is this important?)
Identifying parameter sensitivities gives likely targets for reducing platelet interactions with a surface, and reducing downstream adhesion.
9. Where will you publish these results?

10. What will you be doing in 5 years?
