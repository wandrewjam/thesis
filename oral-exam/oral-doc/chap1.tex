\chapter{Introduction}



%%% Index phrases should be attached to an important word of a phrase,
%%% and are usually best kept on a separate line by terminating the
%%% previous line with a percent comment without intervening space, as
%%% in this example:
%%%
%%%     \newcommand {\X} [1] {#1\index{#1}}
%%%
%%%     African ungulates,%
%%%     \index{African ungulate}
%%%     like the \X{gnu}, \X{impala}, \X{kudu}, and \X{springbok}

%%% However, for this document, we only want lots of index entries to
%%% populate a sample topic index.
