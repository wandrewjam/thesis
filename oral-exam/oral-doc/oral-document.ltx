%%% -*-LaTeX-*-
%%% ====================================================================
%%% This is a sample top-level LaTeX file for typesetting a dissertation
%%% or thesis at the University of Utah in a new design in
%%% 2018 that should permit considerably more flexibility and power in
%%% thesis formatting, while supplying the necessary university-specific
%%% front matter that is a part of any dissertation or thesis.  The
%%% guiding principle of the design is that most standard LaTeX packages
%%% should be usable as extensions to the standard LaTeX book class.
%%% In particular, color, hypertext links in PDF output, indexing,
%%% new float types, optional (starred) arguments in LaTeX macros, PDF
%%% document inclusions (for published journal articles), and running
%%% page headers, are all possible, but optional.
%%%
%%% All style files for typesetting University of Utah dissertations
%%% and theses are prefixed with "uu", and users should NEVER introduce
%%% additional personal styles with that prefix.
%%%
%%% Most students find it convenient to start with a COPY of this file
%%% as a template, and then alter that copy to match their needs.
%%% Please RENAME the sample-thesis-*.* files using a suitable prefix
%%% for YOUR thesis, and adjust the Makefile accordingly.
%%%
%%% There is an associated Unix Makefile that can be similarly
%%% customized, and then the only command ever needed to typeset the
%%% complete thesis is the single word "make".  Of course, during
%%% writing and typesetting, not all of the steps are needed, so
%%% often, one can just name a convenience target such as "make
%%% dvi-pass" or "make pdf-pass" to do just a single pass of LaTeX and
%%% BibTeX.
%%%
%%% There should be no, or very few, macro definitions in this file;
%%% any needed belong in a private style file, perhaps called
%%% mythesis.sty, and input below after all other packages.  The bulk
%%% of this file should just be command invocations, and any arguments
%%% that they need.
%%%
%%% We exploit the fact that TeX ignores spaces after command names to
%%% line up arguments for better readability.
%%%
%%% Each chapter should be a separate complete file, so that you can
%%% insert a command like \includeonly{chap_intro} before the first
%%% \include{chap_xxx} command to avoid typesetting all but the
%%% chapter that you are currently working on, to save time.
%%%
%%% Remember that occupants of job positions change jobs from time to
%%% time: YOU are responsible for ensuring correct names of all humans
%%% mentioned in this file!
%%%
%%% In the rest of this top-level thesis file, comments that contain
%%% the word OPTIONAL hide commands that you might wish to use; just
%%% remove the "%%: OPTIONAL: " comment prefix to enable them.

%%% ====================================================================
%%% Support for showing the sample thesis input and typesetting (NOT

%% \usepackage {fancyvrb}                  % for displaying this book's LaTeX input

%% \usepackage {colortbl}                  % for color shading in tables

%%% ====================================================================
%%% Support for brief and extended tables of contents (helpful for
%%% large documents with many document sections):

\usepackage {shorttoc}

%%% ====================================================================
%%% This tells BibTeX to read x-plain.bst from the first directory where
%%% it is found in the BSTINPUTS search path:

\usepackage {x-bst}                     % for macros produced by x-plain.bst
\bibliographystyle {plain}

%%% ====================================================================
%%% Support for a subject index:

\usepackage {uuthesis-index}            % for document indexing

%%% ====================================================================
%%% The various uuthesis-*.sty packages must come AFTER all other
%%% system-provided packages, so that they can correctly override
%%% settings from those packages.

%%% This is an OPTIONAL package that sets chapter and sectional headings
%%% in color:
%%% Use one or the other of these:
% \usepackage {color}
\usepackage {uuthesis-color}            % for improved color support
%% \definecolor {utahheadingcolor} {rgb}  {0.7, 0.0, 0.0}
%% \definecolor {utahtheoremcolor} {rgb}  {0.490,0.149,0.804} % purple4
\definecolor {utahtheoremcolor} {rgb}  {0.545,0.137,0.137} % brown4

%%% Here is another, and more convenient, way to define colors, via
%%% aliases of named colors in the X11-derived rgb.sty file

%% \definecolor {utahred} {rgb} {0.8, 0.0, 0.0}
%% \definecoloralias {utahgray} {gray40}
%% \definecoloralias {utahheadingcolor}{utahgray}
%% \definecoloralias {utahheadingcolor}{utahgreen}
%% \definecoloralias {utahheadingcolor}{darkgreen}
%% \definecoloralias {utahtheoremcolor}{forestgreen}
\definecoloralias {utahheadingcolor}{utahred}

%%% The default heading color is utahred (defined by University Printing
%%% Services as 0.8 red, 0.0 green, 0.0 blue), but you could redefine
%%% that to, for example, a dark blue color, like this AFTER including
%%% the package:
%%%
%%%     \definecolor {utahheading} {rgb} {0,0,0.8}
%%%
%%% NB: Be careful with use of colors in typesetting, and in figures,
%%% because about 6 percent of the human male population is red/green
%%% color blind: they see those colors as shades of brown.  Red and
%%% blue, or blue and green, are better choices for choosing
%%% distinguishable colors.  Also, avoid light colors, especially
%%% yellow, because they are hard to see against white paper and
%%% screen backgrounds, and when printed on black-and-white printers,
%%% where they are rendered in gray, they may be too faint to read.

%%% ====================================================================
%%% Include latest updates for 2018 version 2.00 base release

\usepackage {uuthesis-updates}          % MANDATORY and LAST of all uuthesis-* packages

%%% ====================================================================
%%% Support for hypertext links in PDF output:

\usepackage [pdftex,hidelinks]{hyperref}          % for hypertext
                                % links

%%% ====================================================================
%%% This single user-specific file is where all personal customizations
%%% and macro definitions should be placed, and it should come LAST,
%%% after ALL OTHER packages, in case it needs to override some of their
%%% definitions.

\usepackage {mythesis}                  % for personally-defined macros

%%% ====================================================================
%%% The student-specific front matter fields are defined here:

\author                 {Andrew Watson}
\title                  {Towards a model of platelet rolling along and
  activation by a reactive surface} 
\thesistype             {dissertation}

\dedication             {For my parents, Nancy and David.}

%%% Most students need just a short degree name, like this:
\degree                 {Doctor of Philosophy}
%%% However, multiline degrees are possible, and are done like this:
%% \degree                 {Doctor of Philosophy \\
%%                          in \\
%%                          Mathematical Physics}

%%% For a Master's thesis, use something like this:
%%%
%%% \thesistype             {thesis}
%%%
%%% \degree                 {Master of Science}
%%%
%%% \degree                 {Master of Science \\
%%%                          in \\
%%%                          Experimental Mathematics}
%%%
%%% and omit definitions of \thirdreader and \fourthreader.

%%% College- and Department-level definitions:
\approvaldepartment     {Mathematics}
\department             {Department of Mathematics}
\graduatedean           {David Kieda}
\departmentchair        {Davar Khoshnevisan}

%%% The graduate student's committee members:
\committeechair         {Aaron Fogelson}
\firstreader            {James P. Keener}
\secondreader           {Vladimir Hlady}
\thirdreader            {Christel Hohenegger}
\fourthreader           {Sean Lawley}
\chairtitle             {Professor}

%%% NB: It is rare, but possible, for there to be two chairs, For
%%% example, one student had
%%%
%%% \committeechair{\mbox{\small Andrej Cherkaev and Andrejs Treibergs}}
%%%
%%% The \mbox{} ensures that line breaks cannot happen, and the \small
%%% is necessary to make the names fit on the Dissertation Approval form

%%% Dates that must be adjusted for each academic term, and be permitted
%%% according to the University of Utah Thesis Office:
\submitdate             {May 2019}
\copyrightyear          {2019}

%%% Dates on which committee members approved the thesis

%%% The choice of bibliography style is a major decision, jointly made
%%% by you, your thesis advisor and the thesis editor. Common choices are
%%% one of the four standard BibTeX styles (abbrv, alpha, plain, and unsrt),
%%% or enhanced styles like acm, amsplain, siam, and hundreds of others
%%% available in TeX Live, and other Unix and Windows TeX distributions.
%%%
%%% Do NOT handcode your reference list, because you are unlikely to
%%% achieve consistency or conformance to the University of Utah Thesis Office
%%% requirements: let BibTeX do that tedious job for you!
%%%
%%% Remember that reference-list metadata in BibTeX files remains
%%% constant across journals and publishers, and is are often reused
%%% in other documents and shared with others, whereas formatted
%%% reference-list styles change: with BibTeX, you only need to record
%%% the metadata once.
%%%
%%% If you prefer named, rather than numeric or tagged citations, you
%%% may use styles such as authordate{1,2,3,4}, chicago, harvard, or
%%% natbib.  Be aware, however, that most of those require an
%%% additional \usepackage{} command to supply \LaTeX{} with
%%% definitions of commands that the style needs, and that there are
%%% usually several flavors of LaTeX citation commands beyond the
%%% standard \cite{} command that you need to understand before you
%%% can use them properly in your prose.

%%% This can also specify a comma-separated list (without embedded
%%% spaces) of *.bib files found by BibTeX in its BIBINPUTS search
%%% path.  The argument \jobname means the base name of the top-level
%%% LaTeX file, avoiding an unnecessary filename dependence here.
%%%
%%% BibTeX writes only one .bbl file, no matter how many *.bib files
%%% are listed here, using the name \jobname.bbl.
%%%
%%% LaTeX reads BibTeX's formatted reference list from the file
%%% \jobname.bbl.

\bibliography{\jobname}

%%% The last part of this sample thesis is two specialized indexes,
%%% and a general topic index.  If the companion Makefile is used to
%%% create the DVI or PDF file for this work, the topic index excludes
%%% the lengthy list of free software packages.  However, the biology
%%% names of the first index are included in the topic index.

%%% Switch from thesis double spacing to single spacing for the three
%%% indexes, as a matter of style (to match the reference list), and
%%% for compactness.

%% \singlespace

%% %%% Define several index cross references (there are many more such
