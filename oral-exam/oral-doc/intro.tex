% 1. Description of the priming project

% Why is hemocompatibility important?

Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death in the
U.S, and a common treatment for these diseases is to implant medical
devices into the blood stream. For example, stents (an expandable
solid mesh) are often used to treat stenotic arteries. However, the
introduction of a foreign material into the blood stream will cause
thrombosis unless the material is treated somehow, and while these
devices have been effective in saving lives, they are still far from
perfect. Patients with these implanted devices still must be placed on
anticoagulants, as they have a higher risk of a thrombotic event even
when the device is functional and surgery is successful (cit: ref 9 in
Colin's thesis--Cannegieter et. al., 1994).
		
% What has been done so far in hemocompatibility research, and what is
% Vlado's group trying to add?

Most hemocompatibility studies focus on local interactions and effects
of the material on platelets. However recent work (cit: Dr. Hlady's
work) has shown that nonlocal effects are also important in
understanding platelet interactions with implanted biomaterials. In
particular they have shown that platelet interactions with immobilized
agonists may not cause the platelets to adhere at the site of
interaction, but can nonetheless prime them for downstream adhesion
and full activation. One possible example of this in a vascular graft
is shown in Figure \# something. At either end of the implanted
device, native tissue must be joined with the artificial device. At
these points along the vessel wall the tissue is inflamed and
anastomotic (source?), which could expose platelet agonists on the
surface of the wall. Additionally the increased shear rate in the
stenotic regions could act as a platelet agonist (source?). Therefore
while platelets may not bind to a single inflamed region of the
vessel, the upstream region may prime platelets for adhesion, and then
more readily bind to the downstream inflamed region. It is also
possible that the inflamed tissue or the biomaterial may not cause
platelets to bind locally, but nonetheless partially activate
platelets and cause them to adhere downstream somewhere in the
circulation.
		
% Describe experimental setup, ongoing experiments, etc
In order to investigate nonlocal effects of priming, Dr. Hlady's group
has designed a microfluidic assay with two regions printed with
platelet agonists (see Figure whatever). The upstream agonist region
will be called the priming region, and the downstream region with
agonist will be called the capture region. In previous research,
Dr. Hlady's group has found that all 3 immobilized platelet agonists
tested (vWF, collagen, and fibrinogen) in the upstream region
increased adhesion of platelets in the capture region relative to a
nonreactive control (Colin's thesis, Corum paper). Also, recent
unpublished work has shown similar results when the upstream agonist
printing is replaced by a stenotic region with higher wall shear rates
(reference Shek's work).
	
% 2. Contextualize rolling within blood clotting
% Process of clotting begins when agonists (vWF and collagen) are exposed on the ECs
In order for a platelet aggregate to form, two processes (wording?)
need to occur: platelet adhesion to the vessel wall, and cohesion
among platelets. In normal hemostasis, adhesion is facilitated by two
surface-immobilized proteins: collagen embedded in the sub-endothelial
matrix, and von Willebrand factor (vWF) which can either be bound to
collagen in the SE matrix or expressed by endothelial cells in
pathological circumstances (see refs in Fogelson and Neeves, 2015,
pp. 384 \& 390).
		
% Platelets bind to these agonists with fast receptors first (GP1b and
% GPVI), and then later with slow receptors (\alpha{IIb} \beta{3} and
% \alpha{2} \beta{1}).
Platelets constitutively express GP1b and GPVI receptors for vWF and
collagen respectively (see refs in Fogelson and Neeves 2015,
p. 384). These receptors have fast binding and unbinding kinetics, and
are therefore able to form bonds with their surface-immobilized
ligands even when the platelets are in flows with high wall shear
rates. When these bonds form and are stretched beyond their rest
length, they exert a force in opposition to the flow and slow the
platelet down. Therefore the motion of a platelet along a wall with
immobilized agonists is a function of the biochemical interactions of
receptors and ligands as well as the fluid forces exerted on the
platelet.
		
% The fast receptors trigger intracellular signaling cascades that
% result in platelet activation and activation of the slow receptors.
These receptors are more than simple physical links between the
platelet and surface. When they are bound with a ligand, they initiate
intracellular signaling cascades that are responsible for triggering
release of intracellular calcium and activating
phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) which are two crucial events in
platelet activation (Bye paper; look at Fogelson and Neeves; Du
paper?). These activation pathways ultimately terminate in a suite of
responses that are collectively called "platelet activation,"
including granule secretion, TxA2 synthesis, cytoskeletal
rearrangements, and activation of integrins \ITA{IIb}\ITB{3} and
\ITA{2}\ITB{1}. These integrins are receptors for fibrinogen/vWF
and collagen, respectively. They are constitutively expressed on the
surface of the platelet (check this!), but on unactivated platelets
they exist mostly in their low-affinity conformation (sources?).
		
In general, integrins form a large group of transmembrane receptors
that are primarily involved in the adhesion of cells to extracellular
matrix (ECM) and cell locomotion. They have a large extracellular
domain called the ectodomain with a hinge. In the low affinity
conformation, the ectodomain is bent at the hinge and the ligand
binding domain is at least partially blocked. When switching from
low-affinity to high-affinity conformations the integrin ectodomain
extends at the hinge to reveal the ligand binding site (sources). Note
I've avoided using the words "inactive" and "active." This is
intentional: there is evidence that integrins retain some ability to
form bonds with their ligands when in the low-affinity conformation
(sources), and experiments showing that resting platelets can bind to
fibrinogen (sources) also suggest this is possible.
		
Once integrins are bound and in their high-affinity conformation, they
can activate signal transduction pathways to initiate the formation of
clusters of integrins that mediate firm adhesion of a cell to ECM
(sources), along with other responses.
	
% Once platelets are activated, they can bind firmly to the wall,
% release soluble platelet agonists which causes a platelet aggregate
% to form, and release thrombin which results in the formation of a
% fibrin gel which ultimately stabilizes a clot.

% 3. Description of cell rolling, a single cell interacting with the surface
% Should mention margination in here somewhere.
% Cell rolling is the important first part of the process of platelet activation.
% There are three main insoluble platelet agonists: vWF, collagen, and fibrinogen.
% Two important constitutively active platelet receptors are GP1b
% (binds to vWF) and GPVI (binds to collagen). These receptors have
% fast association and dissociation and mediate platelet rolling along
% a vessel wall.
% There are also constitutively expressed integrins \alpha{IIb}
% \beta{3} and \alpha{2} \beta{1}, however they are in their
% low-affinity conformation.
