\chapter* {\LaTeX{} processing for this dissertation}

With the help of definitions and rules in the \texttt{Makefile}, this
dissertation is typeset in under \emph{nine seconds} with a \emph{single}
operating-system command:

\begin{Verbatim}[formatcom = \color{blue}]
    make
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
That asks the \texttt{make} utility to run these commands to produce a
consistent typeset dissertation in Portable Document Format (PDF):

\begin{Verbatim}[formatcom = \color{blue}]
    egrep -v '^%|^ *$' sample-thesis-1.tex > sample-thesis-1.stripped

    test -f sample-thesis-1-bioname.ind || touch sample-thesis-1-bioname.ind
    test -f sample-thesis-1-fsfname.ind || touch sample-thesis-1-fsfname.ind
    pdflatex sample-thesis-1.ltx
    bibtex sample-thesis-1
    mv sample-thesis-1.idx sample-thesis-1.idx.old
    cat < sample-thesis-1.idx.old > sample-thesis-1.idx
    fgrep -v fsfname sample-thesis-1.idx |
        makeindex -c -s sample-thesis-1.ist > sample-thesis-1.ind
    fgrep bioname sample-thesis-1.idx    |
        fgrep -v '|see'                  |
            makeindex -c -s sample-thesis-1.ist > sample-thesis-1-bioname.ind
    fgrep fsfname sample-thesis-1.idx    |
        fgrep -v '|see'                  |
            makeindex -c -s sample-thesis-1.ist > sample-thesis-1-fsfname.ind

    [same command block, repeated 3 more times]
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
The \texttt{egrep} filtering step is needed to remove empty lines and
comments, producing the bare \LaTeX{} commands shown earlier.  Cross
references in the dissertation text, and also inside bibliography
entries, require multiple runs of \texttt{pdflatex} and
\texttt{bibtex}.  At each step, the newly-created raw index file,
\texttt{sample-thesis-1.idx}, is filtered to derive three formatted
and sorted index files, \texttt{*.ind}, that are read and typeset
on the next run of \texttt{pdflatex}.

The \texttt{cat} command simply copies its input to its output, but a
simple redefinition of the \texttt{FIXIDX} macro in the
\texttt{Makefile} can turn it into a filter that modifies the raw
index file.
