For model simulation python-2.7.3, numpy-1.7.1, scipy-0.13.0 and matplotlib-1.3.1 packages are required.
After their installation (in written order) you can start the simulation of platelets subpopulation formation by
writing in console "python platelet.py" (Of course you need to choose the right folder in console)

Also you can start the simulation of other modules (for instance, Serca2b) by writing in console "python Serca2b.py"
