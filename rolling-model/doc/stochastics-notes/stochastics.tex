{\Large Notes on ``A modified next reaction method...''
  \cite{Anderson2007} and its application to platelet rolling}
\end{center}

The old approach I've been using to simulate platelet rolling is a
naive modification of the Gillespie algorithm where at each time step
in the simulation, I calculate two random numbers: one representing
the first time a reaction occurs, and the second representing which
particular reaction occurs. The modification I made is to enforce a
maximum time step, and if no reaction occurs before that maximum time
step I update the position of the platelet and the positions of the
bonds, but I do not create or destroy any bonds (i.e. no reactions
occur). Then I repeat the process, generating a new pair of random
numbers and comparing them to the maximum time step.

There are a couple of weaknesses in this approach. First, because I
generate two random numbers for every single time step, and in my
simulations the maximum time step I enforce is much smaller than
the average time for a bond to form or break, I end up wasting most of
the random numbers I generate. In a typical simulation, I use
$\sim10^4$ time steps but only $\sim10$---$100$ reactions occur in
a simulation. That is, I generate about 20,000 random numbers, but
only use 20---200 of them and discard the rest. The second problem is
that this method is a very crude way to integrate the motion of the
platelet. Let me explain this a little more thoroughly.

The motion of a rolling platelet is piecewise deterministic: that is,
in between bond formation/breaking events, the motion of the platelet
is deterministic. With the method described above, I am really
integrating the motion of the platelet using a forward Euler method
with a constant step size. The biggest issue with this is that the
nondimensional friction coefficient for the platelet motion is very
small, and so the ODEs governing platelet motion are stiff, requiring
a very small step size in order for the Forward Euler method to be
stable. The notes that follow develop a method that more clearly
separates the simulation of the deterministic motion of the platelet
from the stochastic simulation of chemical reaction events so that
each of these separate processes can be dealt with in a more
sophisticated way.

\section{Notes on ``A modified next reaction method for simulating
  chemical systems with time dependent propensities and delays''}
\label{sec:notes-modified-nrm}

The fundamental premise of the Gillespie algorithm and related methods
\cite{Gillespie2007} is that each chemical reaction $k$ proceeds with
a propensity function $a_j(\mathbf{x})$ that depends on the state of
the system $\mathbf{x}$ and defined so that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:prop-def}
  a_k(\mathbf{x}) \dd t \equiv \tn{the probability that reaction $k$
    takes place in a small time interval $[t, t+\dd t)$}.
\end{equation}

Based on this assumption, the time $\Delta t_k$ that it takes for
reaction $k$ to fire is exponentially distributed with rate parameter
$a_k(\mathbf{x})$. As mentioned above, for each time step in the
Gillespie algorithm, two random numbers are generated. The first is
used to find the minimum firing time over all the reactions (the
minimum firing time is exponentially distributed with rate parameter
$a_0(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^M a_k(\mathbf{x})$), and the second is
used to find which reaction occurred (reaction $k$ occurred with
probability $a_k(\mathbf{x}) / a_0 (\mathbf{x})$).

\subsection{Next reaction method}
\label{sec:next-reaction-method}

In the Gillespie algorithm, two random numbers must be generated at
each time step, and the number of random numbers that must be
generated is independent of the number of possible reactions. For
chemical systems where the number of time steps is large relative to
the number of possible reactions, the next reaction method improves on
the Gillespie algorithm in that fewer random numbers are required to
advance the simulation. However the feature that is most relevant for
these notes is that the next reaction method is more easily
generalized to the case where reaction rates are explicitly dependent
on time.

For the next reaction method, we represent the reaction times of each
individual reaction as the firing times of Poisson processes. Let
$R_k(t)$ be the number of times the $k$th reaction has occurred before
time $t$. $R_k(t)$ can be represented as a Poisson process with a
nondimensional firing rate related to the reaction rate. Specifically,
if we define $k$ independent Poisson processes with unit firing rate:
$Y_k(\tau)$, then
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:R-def}
  R_k(t) = Y_k\left(\int_0^t a_k(X(s)) ds \right).
\end{equation}

Anderson defines the \emph{internal time} of reaction $k$ as $T_k(t)$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:T-def}
  T_k(t) \equiv \int_0^t a_k(X(s)) ds.
\end{equation}
The internal time is a nondimensional quantity that scales time in the
$k$th Poisson process based on the reaction rate $a_k(X(t))$.

The idea of the next reaction method is to calculate the firing times
of each Poisson process independently, and then to find the minimum
firing time. The system is updated based on which reaction fired, and
the internal times of each reaction are updated appropriately. All of
the firing times of the other reactions are saved, and a new firing
time is generated only for the reaction which fired.

More explicitly, define $P_k$ to be the first firing time of $Y_k$ (in
the time scale of $Y_k$) after $T_k(t)$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:P-def}
  P_k(t) = \min\{s > T_k(t) \mid Y_k(s) > Y_k(T_k(t)) \}.
\end{equation}

Then from the definition of $T_k(t)$ the absolute time required for
reaction $k$ to fire $\Delta t_k$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dtk-def}
  \int_t^{t + \Delta t_k} a_k(X(s)) ds = P_k - T_k.
\end{equation}


Assuming $X(s)$ is constant in $[t, t + \Delta t_k)$, then so is $a_k$
(as long as $a_k$ doesn't explicitly depend on time) and
$\Delta t_k = (P_k - T_k)/a_k$. This gives us the following algorithm
for the next reaction method for autonomous reaction rates:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initialize chemical species, set $t=0$, and $T_k = 0$ for
  each $k$
\item Calculate $a_k$ for each reaction.
\item Generate $M$ independent, uniform random numbers $r_k$.
\item For each $k$, set $P_k = \log(1/r_k)$ (find the internal firing
  times of each reaction).
\item For each $k$, set $\Delta t_k = (P_k - T_k)/a_k$ (convert the
  internal firing times to absolute firing times).
\item Set $\Delta = \min_k \{\Delta t_k\}$ and
  $\mu = \operatorname{argmin}_k \{\Delta t_k\}$.
\item Set $t = t + \Delta$ and update the number of molecular species
  associated with reaction $\mu$.
\item For each $k$, set $T_k = T_k + a_k \Delta$ (advance the internal
  times).
\item For reaction $\mu$, choose a new random number $r$ and set
  $P_\mu = P_\mu + \log(1/r)$.
\item Recalculate the reaction rates $a_k$.
\item Go to 5.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{A simple enzymatic reaction}
\label{sec:simple-enzym-react}

In the plots below, I show results of simulations of a simple
enzymatic reaction
$\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C} \rightarrow
\mathrm{B} + \mathrm{P}$ with rates $k^+ = 1$, $k^- = 5$, and
$k^\text{cat} = 5$ using the Gillespie and next reaction methods and
compare the results with the solution of the ODE reaction rate
equation. This chemical system gives the following set of ODEs:
\begin{align}
\frac{da}{dt} &= -k^+ ab + k^- c \\
\frac{db}{dt} &= -k^+ ab + (k^- + k^\text{cat}) c \\
\frac{dc}{dt} &= k^+ ab - (k^- + k^\text{cat}) c
\end{align}
and the following set of propensity functions $a_k(X(t))$:
\begin{align}
a_1 &= k^+ ab \\
a_2 &= k^- c \\
a_3 &= k^\text{cat} c.
\end{align}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{nrm-example-const}
  \caption{Number of species A in the enzymatic system above, with
    initial numbers $A(0) = 50$, $B(0) = 20$, and $C(0) = 0$. For the
    Gillespie and Next reaction curves, results are averaged over 10
    trials.}
  \label{fig:nrm-example-const}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Time-dependent reaction rates}
\label{sec:time-depend-react}

If we now assume that the reaction rates can change explicitly as a
function of time (that is $a_k = a_k(X(t), t)$), we can apply the next
reaction method described above to this new case in a fairly
straightforward way. $P_k$ and $T_k$ are defined in the same way as
above, the only difference is that now $T_k$ is not necessarily a
piecewise linear function of the absolute time $t$.

In the algorithm described above, only steps 5 and 8 change. In step 5
to find the absolute firing times of each reaction $\Delta t_k$, we
must now solve
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:step-5}
  \int_t^{t + \Delta t_k} a_k(X(t), s) ds = P_k - T_k.
\end{equation}

In step 8 to advance each internal clock, we now have to set
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:step-8}
  T_k = T_k + \int_t^{t + \Delta} a_k(X(t), s) ds.
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:nrm-example-var} shows results from simulations of the
same chemical system as above, but with exponentially decreasing
reaction rates. That is, $k^+(t) = k^+_0 \exp(-Rt)$ and similarly for
the other reaction rates. As $R \rightarrow 0$, this system approaches
the system above with constant reaction rates. Taking an average over
more trials does give better agreement between the deterministic and
stochastic models, I used a relatively small number of trials in order
to show the randomness in the system.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{nrm-example-var}
  \caption{Number of species A in the enzymatic system with
    exponentially decaying reaction rates. Again, the Next reaction
    curve is the result of averaging over 10 independent trials. The
    initial conditions are the same as in Figure 1, and $R = 5$.}

\section{The modified next reaction method applied to platelet
  rolling}
\label{sec:plt-rolling}

In the case of platelet rolling, it is clear that the reaction rates
(i.e. bond formation and breaking rates) depend on time through the
position of the platelet, and the method for simulating time-dependent
reactions can nearly be directly applied to simulate random bond
formation and breaking.

Let's look at the force-balance equations for the platelet. We have
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:vel-force-bal}
  0 &= \ndVelFriction \left(\ndAppliedVel - \ndVelocity \right) +
      \ndHorzTotalForce \\
  \label{eq:rot-force-bal}
  0 &= \ndRotFriction \left(\ndAppliedRot - \ndRotation \right) +
      \ndTotalTorque
\end{align}
where $\ndHorzTotalForce = \sum_{i=1}^\mathtt{n\_bonds}
(\sin\recAngle_i - \ndWallDist_i )$ and $\ndTotalTorque =
-\sum_{i=1}^\mathtt{n\_bonds} [(1 - \cos\recAngle_i +
\ndSeparation)\sin\recAngle_i + (\sin\recAngle_i -
\ndWallDist_i)\cos\recAngle_i]$.

The motion of the platelet is defined so that
$\Der{\ndWallDist_i}{\dTime} = -\ndVelocity$ and
$\Der{\recAngle_i}{\dTime} = -\ndRotation$ for all $i = 1, \hdots
\mathtt{n\_bonds}$. These differential equations have the solution
$\ndWallDist_i(\dTime) = -\ndVelocity \dTime + \ndWallDist_i^0$ and
$\recAngle_i(\dTime) = -\ndRotation \dTime + \recAngle_i^0$. The
time-dependent piece of these equations is independent of $i$, and so
we can write $\ndWallDist_i(\dTime)$ and $\recAngle_i(\dTime)$ in
terms of an initial value (that varies only over $i$) plus a reference
point that varies only over $\dTime$:
\begin{align}
  \ndWallDist_i(t) &= \ndWallDist_\tn{ref}(\dTime) + \ndWallDist_i^0
                     \quad \tn{where} \quad
                     \ndWallDist_\tn{ref}(\dTime) \equiv
                     -\ndVelocity\dTime \\
  \recAngle_i(t) &= \recAngle_\tn{ref}(\dTime) + \recAngle_i^0 \quad
                   \tn{where} \quad \recAngle_\tn{ref}(\dTime) \equiv
                   -\ndRotation \dTime.
\end{align}

From the definitions of $\ndWallDist_\tn{ref}$ and
$\recAngle_\tn{ref}$, we can rewrite equations
\eqref{eq:vel-force-bal} and \eqref{eq:rot-force-bal} as a set of
ODEs:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:wall-evol}
  \Der{\ndWallDist_\tn{ref}}{\dTime}
  &= -\ndAppliedVel + F_h'\left(\ndWallDist_\tn{ref},
    \recAngle_\tn{ref} \right)/\ndVelFriction \\
  \label{eq:plt-evol}
  \Der{\recAngle_\tn{ref}}{\dTime}
  &= -\ndAppliedRot + \tau'\left(\ndWallDist_\tn{ref},
    \recAngle_\tn{ref} \right)/\ndRotFriction.
\end{align}

Assuming that no bonds form or break in the time interval
$[t_1, t_2]$, integrating equations \eqref{eq:wall-evol} and
\eqref{eq:plt-evol} gives the position of the platelet at the times in
that interval. Knowing the position and orientation of the platelet at
all times $\dTime$ in some interval also means that the bond formation
and breaking rates are also known for all times in that
interval. Therefore equations \eqref{eq:wall-evol} and
\eqref{eq:plt-evol} give us a way to evaluate the integral in
equations \eqref{eq:step-5} and \eqref{eq:step-8}.

One consideration we have to make is that we don't know \emph{a
  priori} how long to integrate the above system to guarantee that a
reaction fires in the time interval of integration. My solution to
this is to augment the system with equations of the form
$\Der{F_k}{\dTime} = a_k(\ndWallDist_\tn{ref}, \recAngle_\tn{ref})$
where the $a_k$s are bond formation/breaking rates. That is, to
integrate the reaction rates along with equations of motion, and
then integrate the augmented system until one of the reactions fires.

The full stochastic simulation algorithm for our platelet rolling
model is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initialize platelet velocities $\ndVelocity$ and $\ndRotation$,
  and \verb|bond_list|. Set $\dTime = 0$ and $T_k = 0$ for each of the
  $2N$ bins on the platelet surface, and any bonds that exist in the
  initial condition.
\item Generate $2N + \mathtt{n\_bonds}$ independent, uniform random
  numbers $r_k$.
\item Set $P_k = \log(1/r_k)$ for each $k$ (i.e. set the internal
  firing times for each reaction).
\item Define $\dTime_0$ to be the current time $\dTime$,
  $\ndWallDist_i^0$ to be the current $\ndWallDist$ coordinates of the
  existing bonds, and $\recAngle_i^0$ to be the current $\recAngle$
  coordinates of the existing bonds.
\item Set up the ODE system
  \begin{align}
    \Der{\ndWallDist_\tn{ref}}{\dTime}
    &= -\ndAppliedVel + F_h'\left(\ndWallDist_\tn{ref},
      \recAngle_\tn{ref} \right)/\ndVelFriction \\
    \Der{\recAngle_\tn{ref}}{\dTime}
    &= -\ndAppliedRot + \tau'\left(\ndWallDist_\tn{ref},
      \recAngle_\tn{ref} \right)/\ndRotFriction \\
    \Der{F_k}{\dTime} &= a_k\left(\ndWallDist_\tn{ref},
    \recAngle_\tn{ref} \right).
  \end{align}
  with initial conditions $\ndWallDist_\tn{ref}(\dTime_0) =
  \recAngle_\tn{ref}(\dTime_0) = 0$ and $F_k(\dTime_0) = T_k - P_k$. 
\item Integrate the ODE system until:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The end of the stochastic simulation $T_\tn{end}$ is reached,
  \item One of the $F_k$s reaches 0 (i.e. a reaction fires), or
  \item One of the bond endpoints exits the numerical domain.
  \end{enumerate}
\item If one of the bond endpoints exited the numerical domain, break
  the appropriate bond, update the bond positions and bin positions on
  the platelet, and return to step 4.
\item If the $k$th reaction fired, either add or remove a bond as
  needed, update the bond positions and bin positions, and return to
  step 4.
\item If $T_\tn{end}$ was reached, end the simulation. 
\end{enumerate}
