# Rolling Project
## Introduction

1. Description of the priming project
	- Why is hemocompatibility important?
	- What has been done so far in hemocompatibility research, and what is Vlado's group trying to add? (local to nonlocal)
	- Describe experimental setup, ongoing experiments, ...
	
2. Contextualize rolling within blood clotting
	- Process of clotting begins when agonists (vWF and collagen) are exposed on the ECs
	- Platelets bind to these agonists with fast receptors first (GP1b and GPVI), and then later with slow receptors (\alpha{IIb} \beta{3} and \alpha{2} \beta{1}).
	- The fast receptors trigger intracellular signaling cascades that result in platelet activation and activation of the slow receptors.
	- Once platelets are activated, they can bind firmly to the wall, release soluble platelet agonists which causes a platelet aggregate to form, and release thrombin which results in the formation of a fibrin gel which ultimately stabilizes a clot. 

3. Description of cell rolling, a single cell interacting with the surface
	- Should mention margination in here somewhere.
	- Cell rolling is the important first part of the process of platelet activation.
	- There are three main insoluble platelet agonists: vWF, collagen, and fibrinogen.
	- Two important constitutively active platelet receptors are GP1b (binds to vWF) and GPVI (binds to collagen). These receptors have fast association and dissociation and mediate platelet rolling along a vessel wall.
	- There are also constitutively expressed integrins \alpha{IIb} \beta{3} and \alpha{2} \beta{1}, however they are in their low-affinity conformation.
