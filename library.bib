abstract = {At the onset of inflammation, 20–80{\%} of all leukocytes passing postcapillary venules roll along the endothelium. Recent blocking experiments with antibodies and soluble adhesion receptor molecules, as well as in vitro reconstitution experiments, suggest that leukocyte rolling is mediated by adhesion molecules that belong to the selectin family. What differentiates a selectin-counterreceptor interaction that leads to leukocyte rolling from others that mediate firm adhesion after static incubation but no adhesion when incubated under flow conditions? Here, we explore this question by introducing a quantitative biophysical model that is compatible with the laws of mechanics as applied to rolling leukocytes and the present biochemical and biophysical data on selectin mediated interactions. Our computational experiments point to an adhesion mechanism in which the rate of bond formation is high and the detachment rate low, except at the rear of the contact area where the stretched bonds detach at a high uniform rate. The bond length and bond flexibility play a critical role in enhancing leukocyte rolling at a wide range of fluid shear rates. {\textcopyright} 1992, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Blood platelet activation is required to allow their participation in hemostasis and thrombosis. It is regulated by a complicated signaling network, whose functioning has been recently attracting attention for basic research and pharmacological purposes. Phospholipase s{\{}cyrillic{\}} (PLC) is an enzyme playing an important role in platelet calcium signaling and responsible for release of inositol triphosphate (IP3) into platelet cytoplasm thus controlling intracellular calcium concentration. Using a comprehensive computational model of platelet calcium signaling, we studied the influence of the positive feedback executed by cytosolic calcium on the PLC isoform $\beta$2 during platelet activation. With the positive feedback, the model predicted hyperintensive response to platelet activation by thrombin, where non-physiologically high calcium concentrations arose. However, if one took into account a negative feedback determined by IP3 3-kinase (IP3K), combination of the feedback resulted in the formation of a stepped response (with a stable oscillation amplitude and activation-dependent duration). Stochastic simulations confirmed that PLC and IP3K should act in pair to ensure platelet's "all-or-none" response to activation, when the activation level sets the probability of platelet activation, but not its intensity.},

VWF is a concatenated, multifunctional protein that has binding sites for platelets as well as subendothelial collagen. Binding of the A1 domain in VWF to the glycoprotein Ib alpha subunit (GPIbalpha) on the surface of platelets mediates crosslinking of platelets to one another and the formation of a platelet plug for arterioles. The importance of VWF is illustrated by its mutation in von Willebrand disease, a bleeding diathesis. Here, we describe a novel mechanochemical specialization of the A1-GPIbalpha bond for force-resistance. We have developed a method that enables, for the first time, repeated measurements of the binding and unbinding of a receptor and ligand in a single molecule (ReaLiSM). We demonstrate two states of the receptor-ligand bond, that is, a flex-bond. One state is seen at low force; a second state begins to engage at 10 pN with a approximately 20-fold longer lifetime and greater force resistance. The lifetimes of the two states, how force exponentiates lifetime, and the kinetics of switching between the two states are all measured. For the first time, single-molecule measurements on this system are in agreement with bulk phase measurements. The results have important implications not only for how platelets bound to VWF are able to resist force to plug arterioles, but also how increased flow activates platelet plug formation.},

abstract = {The role of platelets in hemostasis and thrombosis is dependent on a complex balance of activatory and inhibitory signaling pathways. Inhibitory signals released from the healthy vasculature suppress platelet activation in the absence of platelet receptor agonists. Activatory signals present at a site of injury initiate platelet activation and thrombus formation; subsequently, endogenous negative signaling regulators dampen activatory signals to control thrombus growth. Understanding the complex interplay between activatory and inhibitory signaling networks is an emerging challenge in the study of platelet biology and necessitates a systematic approach to utilize experimental data effectively. In this review, we will explore the key points of platelet regulation and signaling that maintain platelets in a resting state, mediate activation to elicit thrombus formation or provide negative feedback. Platelet signaling will be described in terms of key signaling molecules that are common to the pathways activated by platelet agonists and can be described as regulatory nodes for both positive and negative regulators.

abstract = {In this study we examined whether monocytic cell attachment to vascular endothelium was affected by elevating shear stress at a constant shear rate. Contact time, which is inversely related to the shear rate, was fixed and viscosity elevated with dextran to increase the shear stress (and hence the net force on the cell) independently of shear rate. At a fixed contact time, tethering frequencies increased, rolling velocities decreased, and median arrest durations increased with increasing shear stress. Rolling and short arrests ({\textless} 0.2 s) were well fit by a single exponential consistent with adhesion via the formation of a single additional bond. The cell dissociation constant, k(off), increased when the shear stress was elevated at constant shear rate. Firmly adherent cells arresting for at least 0.2 s were well fit by a stochastic model involving dissociation from multiple bonds. Therefore, at a fixed contact time and increasing shear stress, bonds formed more frequently for rolling cells resulting in more short arrests, and more bonds formed for firmly arresting cells resulting in longer arrest durations. Possible mechanisms for this increased adhesion include greater monocyte deformation and/or more frequent penetration of microvilli through steric and charge barriers.},

abstract = {Platelet-dependent arterial thrombosis triggers most heart attacks and strokes. Because the coagulation protease thrombin is the most potent activator of platelets, identification of the platelet receptors for thrombin is critical for understanding thrombosis and haemostasis. Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) is important for activation of human platelets by thrombin, but plays no apparent role in mouse platelet activation. PAR3 is a thrombin receptor that is expressed in mouse megakaryocytes. Here we report that thrombin responses in platelets from PAR3-deficient mice were markedly delayed and diminished but not absent. We have also identified PAR4, a new thrombin-activated receptor. PAR4 messenger RNA was detected in mouse megakaryocytes and a PAR4-activating peptide caused secretion and aggregation of PAR3-deficient mouse platelets. Thus PAR3 is necessary for normal thrombin responses in mouse platelets, but a second PAR4-mediated mechanism for thrombin signalling exists. Studies with PAR-activating peptides suggest that PAR4 also functions in human platelets, which implies that an analogous dual-receptor system also operates in humans. The identification of a two-receptor system for platelet activation by thrombin has important implications for the development of antithrombotic therapies.},

abstract = {Regulation of platelet activation plays a central role in hemostasis and pathophysiological processes such as coronary artery disease. Thrombin is the most potent activator of platelets. Human platelets express two thrombin receptors, PAR1 and PAR4, both of which signal platelet activation. Evidence is lacking on the mechanism by which PAR1 and PAR4 may differentially signal platelet aggregation. Here we show that at the relatively high concentration of agonist most likely found at the site of a local thrombus, dual inhibition of the P2Y12 receptor and calcium mobilization result in a complete inhibition of PAR4-induced aggregation, while having no effect on either thrombin or PAR1-mediated platelet aggregation. Both PAR1- and PAR4mediated aggregation are independent of calcium mobilization. Furthermore, we show that P2Y12 receptor activation is not required for protease-activated receptor-mediated aggregation at higher agonist concentrations and is only partially required for Rap1 as well as GPIIbIIIa activation. P2Y12 receptor inhibitors clinically in use such as clopidogrel are postulated to decrease platelet aggregation through partial inhibition of PAR1 signaling. Our data, however, indicate that at high local concentrations of thrombin, it is the signaling through PAR4 rather than PAR1 that may be regulated through purinergic feedback. Thus, our data identify an intra-platelet mechanism that may function as a future site for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {We simulate the cross-flow migration of rigid particles such as platelets in a red blood cell (RBC) suspension using the Stokes flow boundary integral equation method. Two types of flow environments are investigated: a suspension undergoing a bulk shear motion and a suspension flowing in a microchannel or duct. In a cellular suspension undergoing bulk shear deformation, the cross-flow migration of particles is diffusional. The velocity fluctuations in the suspension, which are the root cause of particle migration, are analyzed in detail, including their magnitude, the autocorrelation of Lagrangian tracer points and particles, and the associated integral time scales. The orientation and morphology of red blood cells vary with the shear rate, and these in turn cause the dimensionless particle diffusivity to vary non-monotonically with the flow capillary number. By simulating RBCs and platelets flowing in a microchannel of 34 $\mu$m height, we demonstrate that the velocity fluctuations in the core cellular flow region cause the platelets to migrate diffusively in the wall normal direction. A mean lateral velocity of particles, which is most significant near the edge of the cell-free layer, further expels them toward the wall, leading to their excess concentration in the cell-free layer. The calculated shear-induced particle diffusivity in the cell-laden region is in qualitative agreement with the experimental measurements of micron-sized beads in a cylindrical tube of a comparable diameter. In a smaller duct of 10 × 15 $\mu$m cross section, the volume exclusion becomes the dominant mechanism for particle margination, which occurs at a much shorter time scale than the migration in the bigger channel.},

abstract = {Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is a platelet agonist that causes platelet shape change and aggregation as well as generation of thromboxane A2, another platelet agonist, through its effects on P2Y1, P2Y12, and P2X1 receptors. It is now reported that both 2-propylthio-D-$\beta$$\gamma$-dichloromethylene adenosine 5′-triphosphate (AR-C67085), a P2Y12 receptor–selective antagonist, and adenosine-2′-phosphate-5′-phosphate (A2P5P), a P2Y1 receptor–selective antagonist, inhibited ADP-induced thromboxane A2 generation in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that coactivation of the P2Y12 and P2Y1 receptors is essential for this event. SC49992, a fibrinogen receptor antagonist, blocked ADP-induced platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 production in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, P2 receptor antagonists or SC49992 blocked ADP-induced arachidonic acid liberation. Whereas SC49992 blocked arachidonic acid–induced platelet aggregation, it failed to inhibit thromboxane A2 generation induced by arachidonic acid. Thus, ADP-induced arachidonic acid liberation, but not subsequent conversion to thromboxane A2, requires outside-in signaling through the fibrinogen receptor. The Fab fragment of ligand-induced binding site–6 (LIBS6) antibody, which induces a fibrinogen-binding site on the integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3, caused both platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 generation. Inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Syk, Src kinases, or protein tyrosine phosphatases inhibited platelet aggregation but not thromboxane A2 generation, indicating that these signaling molecules have no significant role in phospholipase A2 activation. In the presence of P2 receptor antagonists A2P5P or AR-C67085, LIBS6 failed to generate thromboxane A2, suggesting that inside-out signaling through ADP receptors is necessary for this event. It was concluded that both outside-in signaling from the fibrinogen receptor and inside-out signaling from the P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors are necessary for phospholipase A2 activation, resulting in arachidonic acid liberation and thromboxane A2 generation.},

abstract = {The receptor-mediated adhesion of cells to ligand-coated surfaces in viscous shear flow is an important step in many physiological processes, such as the neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response, lymphocyte homing, and tumor cell metastasis. This paper describes a calculational method which simulates the interaction of a single cell with a ligand-coated surface under flow. The cell is idealized as a microvilli-coated hard sphere covered with adhesive springs. The distribution of microvilli on the cell surface, the distribution of receptors on microvilli tips, and the forward and reverse reaction between receptor and ligand are all simulated using random number sampling of appropriate probability functions. The velocity of the cell at each time step in the simulation results from a balance of hydrodynamic, colloidal and bonding forces; the bonding force is derived by summing the individual contributions of each receptor-ligand tether. The model can simulate the effect of many parameters on adhesion, such as the number of receptors on microvilli tips, the density of ligand, the rates of reaction between receptor and ligand, the stiffness of the resulting receptor-ligand springs, the response of springs to strain, and the magnitude of the bulk hydrodynamic stresses. The model can successfully recreate the entire range of expected and observed adhesive phenomena, from completely unencumbered motion, to rolling, to transient attachment, to firm adhesion. Also, the method can generate meaningful statistical measures of adhesion, including the mean and variance in velocity, rate constants for cell attachment and detachment, and the frequency of adhesion. We find a critical modulating parameter of adhesion is the fractional spring slippage, which relates the strain of a bond to its rate of breakage; the higher the slippage, the faster the breakage for the same strain. Our analysis of neutrophil adhesive behavior on selectin-coated (CD62-coated) surfaces in viscous shear flow reported by Lawrence and Springer (Lawrence, M.B., and T.A. Springer 1991. Cell. 65:859–874) shows the fractional spring slippage of the CD62-LECAM-1 bond is likely below 0.01. We conclude the unique ability of this selectin bond to cause neutrophil rolling under flow is a result of its unique response to strain. Furthermore, our model can successfully recreate data on neutrophil rolling as function of CD62 surface density. {\textcopyright} 1992, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {With a combined phase-contrast and fluorescence video imaging system, changes in morphology and cytosolic [Ca2+]i were investigated of fura-2-loaded platelets during adhesion to fibrinogen or collagen matrices. The Ca2+ signals were, on the level of single platelets, compared to the secretion and procoagulant responses, using fluorescent-labeled AK-6 antibody against P-selectin and labeled annexin V for detection of surface-exposed phosphatidylserine (PS), respectively. Platelets in contact with fibrinogen developed filapods and spread over the matrix, in most of the cells without detectable Ca2+ signal. Thrombin induced repetitive spiking in [Ca2+]i, followed by the expression of P-selectin but not of PS on the platelet surface. Platelet interaction with collagen resulted in spreading and transformation of the cells into blebbing, "balloon"-like structures (diameter about 5 microm). The latter morphological changes were accompanied by high and prolonged increases in [Ca2+]i, by the exposure of both P-selectin and PS, and by the ability of the platelets to convert prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin addition accelerated the onset of the Ca2+ signals and the appearance of surface-exposed PS. Collagen-induced PS exposure was slightly reduced by treatment of the platelets with aspirin, and strongly inhibited by suppression of the Ca2+ responses with prostaglandin E1 or the Ca2+ chelator, dimethyl-BAPTA. Inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation with genistein, U73343, or wortmannin resulted in spiking Ca2+ responses in many of the platelets and in almost complete reduction of bleb formation and PS exposure. In contrast, genistein did not suppress bleb formation and PS exposure of platelets stimulated with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. We conclude that a collagen but not fibrinogen matrix acts as a potent activator of the procoagulant response through activation of tyrosine kinases and subsequent generation of sustained intracellular Ca2+ signals.},

abstract = {The kinetic equations are analysed for a model system which is motivated by the reactions of blood coagulation, and which involves two zymogen-enzyme pairs each of which can exist in solution phase or bound to a membrane. The enzyme of each pair activates the zymogen of the other pair, and each enzyme is subject to first-order inactivation both in solution and when bound to the membrane. If enzyme activation happens exclusively or predominantly in the membrane phase, then the system displays a threshold response which can be modulated by varying the density of membrane binding sites for the zymogens and enzymes. For low densities of membrane binding sites, the system's response when challenged by a dose of enzyme quickly decays away. For high enough densities of membrane binding sites, the system responds with substantial and sustained enzyme production. Thus variations in surface-binding site densities can serve as a "switch", drastically altering the responsiveness of the system. Such a binding-site-mediated switching mechanism could have profound importance to the regulation of enzyme systems, in particular, the blood coagulation system.},

In the concept of cell-based control of coagulation, three different roles of platelets can be distinguished: control of thrombin generation, support of fibrin formation, and regulation of fibrin clot retraction. Here, we postulate that different populations of platelets with distinct surface properties are involved in these coagulant functions. Platelets with elevated Ca(2+) and exposed phosphatidylserine controlling thrombin and fibrin generation, and platelets with activated $\alpha$(IIb) $\beta$(3) integrins regulating clot retraction. We review how coagulation factor binding depends on the platelet activation state. Furthermore, the ligands, platelet receptors and downstream intracellular signaling pathways implicated in these coagulant functions are discussed. We integrate this in an adapted model of platelet-based coagulation. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.},

abstract = {It is currently believed that inactive tyrosine kinase c-Src in platelets binds to the cytoplasmic tail of the $\beta$3 integrin subunit via its SH3 domain. Although a recent NMR study supports this contention, it is likely that such binding would be precluded in inactive c-Src because an auto-inhibitory linker physically occludes the $\beta$3 tail binding site. Accordingly, we have re-examined c-Src binding to $\beta$3 by immunoprecipitation as well as NMR spectroscopy. In unstimulated platelets, we detected little to no interaction between c-Src and $\beta$3. Following platelet activation, however, c-Src was co-immunoprecipitated with $\beta$3 in a time-dependent manner and underwent progressive activation as well. We then measured chemical shift perturbations in the (15)N-labeled SH3 domain induced by the C-terminal $\beta$3 tail peptide NITYRGT and found that the peptide interacted with the SH3 domain RT-loop and surrounding residues. A control peptide whose last three residues where replaced with those of the $\beta$1 cytoplasmic tail induced only small chemical shift perturbations on the opposite face of the SH3 domain. Next, to mimic inactive c-Src, we found that the canonical polyproline peptide RPLPPLP prevented binding of the $\beta$3 peptide to the RT- loop. Under these conditions, the $\beta$3 peptide induced chemical shift perturbations similar to the negative control. We conclude that the primary interaction of c-Src with the $\beta$3 tail occurs in its activated state and at a site that overlaps with PPII binding site in its SH3 domain. Interactions of inactive c-Src with $\beta$3 are weak and insensitive to $\beta$3 tail mutations.},

abstract = {Neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation involves neutrophil rolling along the inflamed endothelium in the presence of shear stress imposed by blood flow. Neutrophil rolling in post-capillary venules in vivo is primarily mediated by P-selectin on the endothelium binding to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) constitutively expressed on neutrophils. Blood flow exerts a hydrodynamic drag on the rolling neutrophil which is partially or fully balanced by the adhesive forces generated in the P-selectin-PSGL-1 bonds. Rolling is the result of rapid formation and dissociation of P-selectin-PSGL-1 bonds at the center and rear of the rolling cell, respectively. Neutrophils roll stably on P-selectin in post-capillary venules in vivo and flow chambers in vitro at wall shear stresses greater than 6dyncm-2. However, the mechanisms that enable neutrophils to roll at such high shear stress are not completely understood. In vitro and in vivo studies have led to the discovery of four potential mechanisms, viz. cell flattening, catch bond behavior, membrane tethers, and slings. Rolling neutrophils undergo flattening at high shear stress, which not only increases the size of the cell footprint but also reduces the hydrodynamic drag experienced by the rolling cell. P-selectin-PSGL-1 bonds behave as catch bonds at small detachment forces and thus become stronger with increasing force. Neutrophils rolling at high shear stress form membrane tethers which can be longer than the cell diameter and promote the survival of P-selectin-PSGL-1 bonds. Finally, neutrophils rolling at high shear stress form 'slings', which act as cell autonomous adhesive substrates and support step-wise peeling. Tethers and slings act together and contribute to the forces balancing the hydrodynamic drag. How the synergy between the four mechanisms leads to stable rolling at high shear stress is an area that needs further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We derive a general system of images for regularized sources, Stokeslets, and other related elements starting from an arbitrary regularization kernel (blob) used in the simulation of Stokes flows in three dimensions bounded by a plane. This generalizes previous work in which the image system for a Stokeslet had been derived for one specific blob. The significance of this generalization is that recent work on regularization methods requires the use of blobs designed to satisfy certain properties, such as zero moment conditions and fast decay, and thus it is absolutely necessary to have the system of images starting from an arbitrary blob. The system of images for a regularized element consists of a set of several elements, usually of higher order, that produce a flow that is zero at the bounding plane. In order for the resultant flow to vanish analytically at the wall, two different but related blobs must be used. For any given blob, we provide the formula for the companion blob that accomplishes the cancellation and we derive a systematic way to compute the image system of regularized Stokeslets, sources and dipoles. Other elements can be derived from these. By taking the limit as the regularization parameter approaches zero, the system of images for the corresponding singular elements is found.},

abstract = {Selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling under flow is an important process in leukocyte recruitment during inflammation. The rolling motion of individual cells has been observed to fluctuate randomly both in vivo and in vitro. This paper presents a stochastic model of the micromechanics of cell rolling and provides an analytical method of treating experimental data. For a homogeneous cell population, the velocity distribution is obtained in an analytical form, which is in good agreement with experimentally determined velocity histograms obtained previously. For a heterogeneous cell population, the model provides a simple, analytical method of separating the contributions of temporal fluctuations and population heterogeneity to the variance of measured rolling velocities. The model also links the mean and variance of rolling velocities to the molecular events underlying the observed cellular motion, allowing characterization of the distribution and release rate of the clusters of molecular bonds that tether the cell to substratum. Applying the model to the analysis of data obtained for neutrophils rolling on an E-selectin-coated surface at a wall shear stress of 1.2 dyn/cm2 yields estimations of the average distance between bond clusters (approximately micron) and the average time duration of a bond cluster resisting the applied fluid force (approximately 0.5 s). {\textcopyright} 1995, The Biophysical Society.

While the downstream signaling of platelet-ligand interactions is well-characterized, biophysical cues, such as hydrodynamic forces and mechanical stiffness of the underlying substrate, also mediate these interactions and affect the binding kinetics of platelets to these proteins. Recent studies have observed that, similar to nucleated cells, platelets mechanosense their microenvironment and exhibit dynamic physiologic responses to biophysical cues. This review discusses how platelet mechanosensing is affected by the hydrodynamic forces that dictate vWF-platelet interactions and fibrin polymerization and network formation. The similarities and differences in mechanosensing between platelets and nucleated cells and integrin-mediated platelet mechanosensing on both fibrin(ogen) and collagen are then reviewed. Further studies investigating how platelets interact with the mechanical microenvironment will improve our overall understanding of the hemostatic process.},

abstract = {While critically important, the platelet function at the high shear rates typical of the microcirculation is relatively poorly understood. Using a large scale Stokes flow simulation, Zhao et al. recently showed that RBC-induced velocity fluctuations cause platelets to marginate into the RBC free near-wall region [Zhao et al., Physics of Fluids, 2012, 24, 011902]. We extend their work by investigating the dynamics of platelets in shear after margination. An overall platelet adhesion model is proposed in terms of a continuous time Markov process and the transition rates are established with numerical simulations involving platelet-wall adhesion. Hydrodynamic drag and Brownian forces are calculated with the boundary element method, while the RBC collisions are incorporated through an autoregressive process. Hookean springs with first order bond kinetics are used to model receptor-ligand bonds formed between the platelet and the wall. The simulations are compared with in vitro microfluidic experiments involving platelet adhesion to Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) coated surfaces.},

Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is one of the main ways in which activation signals are transmitted in platelets. Although much is known about the protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that initiate and propagate activation signals, relatively little is known about the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that modulate these signals in platelets. PTPs are a family of enzymes that dephosphorylate tyrosine residues in proteins and regulate signals transmitted within cells. PTPs have been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, including cancer, diabetes and autoimmunity, but their functions in hemostasis and thrombosis remain largely undefined. Exciting new findings from a number of groups have revealed that PTPs are in fact critical regulators of platelet activation and thrombosis. The primary aim of this review is to highlight the unique and important functions of PTPs in regulating platelet activity. Establishing the functions of PTPs in platelets is essential to better understand the molecular basis of thrombosis and may lead to the development of improved antithrombotic therapies.},

In this article, an adhesive dynamics model of the transient aggregation of two unactivated platelets via GPIb$\alpha$-vWF-GPIb$\alpha$ bridging is developed and integrated with the three-dimensional hydrodynamic flow model discussed in Part I. Platelet binding efficiencies predicted by PAD are in good agreement with platelet aggregation behavior observed experimentally, as documented in the literature. Deviations from average vWF ligand size or healthy GPIb$\alpha$-vWF-A1 binding kinetics are observed in simulations to have significant effects on the dynamics of transient platelet aggregation, i.e., the efficiency of platelet aggregation and characteristics of bond failure, in ways that typify diseased conditions. The GPIb$\alpha$-vWF-A1 bond formation rate is predicted to have piecewise linear dependence on the prevailing fluid shear rate, with a sharp transition in fluid shear dependency at 7200 s-1. Interplatelet bond force-loading is found to be complex and highly nonlinear.

abstract = {Platelet spreading is critical for hemostatic plug formation and thrombosis. However, the detailed dynamics of platelet spreading as a function of receptor-ligand adhesive interactions has not been thoroughly investigated. Using reflection interference contrast microscopy, we found that both adhesive interactions and PAR4 activation affect the dynamics of platelet membrane contact formation during spreading. The initial growth of close contact area during spreading was controlled by the combination of different immobilized ligands or PAR4 activation on fibrinogen, whereas the growth of the total area of spreading was independent of adhesion type and PAR4 signaling. We found that filopodia extend to their maximal length and then contract over time; and that filopodial protrusion and expansion were affected by PAR4 signaling. Upon PAR4 activation, the integrin $\alpha$ IIb$\beta$ 3 mediated close contact to fibrinogen substrata and led to the formation of ringlike patterns in the platelet contact zone. A systematic study of platelet spreading of GPVI-, $\alpha$ 2-, or $\beta$ 3-deficient platelets on collagen or fibrinogen suggests the integrin $\alpha$ 2 is indispensable for spreading on collagen. The platelet collagen receptors GPVI and $\alpha$ 2 regulate integrin $\alpha$ IIb$\beta$ 3- mediated platelet spreading on fibrinogen. This work elucidates quantitatively how receptor-ligand adhesion and biochemical signals synergistically control platelet spreading. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Annexin V, a protein with a high affinity and a strict specificity for aminophospholipids at physiologic calcium concentrations, was used to probe platelet activation and the development of procoagulant activity. Platelet secretion was studied in parallel using VH10, a murine monoclonal antibody specific for GMP-140, an alpha-granule membrane glycoprotein. Both proteins were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and platelet activation was assessed by flow cytometry. Microparticles, which are shed from the platelet surface and also support procoagulant activity, were distinguished from platelets according to their associated light scattering signal. The relative ability of different inducers to trigger exposure of the procoagulant surface and microparticle formation was: ionophore A23187 {\textgreater} thrombin plus collagen {\textgreater} collagen {\textgreater} thrombin. The density of aminophospholipid on microparticles was higher than on remnant platelets. Platelet activation by these agonists was accompanied by GMP-140 exposure, both on platelets and microparticles. Here, thrombin was the most efficient agonist. The mechanisms responsible for the above processes were investigated using E-64-d, a specific membrane-permeable inhibitor of Ca(2+)-activated protease (calpain); tetracaine, an activator of calpain; and N-ethylmaleimide and diamide, two sulfhydryl-reactive agents. These agents were added to platelets alone or before stimulation by agonists. Calpain activity was assessed by the hydrolysis of cytoskeletal proteins as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results showed that calpain activity is not essential for aminophospholipid translocation or for secretion. In contrast, although sulfhydryl-reactive agents alone can trigger procoagulant activity, they inhibit microvesicle formation and platelet secretion induced by the above agonists, suggesting that different mechanisms account for these phenomena. The use of annexin V in flow cytometry is a rapid method to assess procoagulant activity in platelets and the loss of phospholipid asymmetry in cell membranes.},

The equations governing the motion of N particles suspended in a viscous fluid at low particle Reynolds number are solved accurately and efficiently, including all hydrodynamic interactions, but with a significantly lower computational cost of O(N lnN). The main differences from the conventional SD method lie in the calculation of the many-body long- range interactions, where the Ewald-summed wave-space contribution is calculated as a Fourier transform sum and in the iterative inversion of the now sparse resistance matrix. The new method is applied to problems in the rheology of both structured and random suspensions, and accurate results are obtained with much larger numbers of particles. With access to larger N, the high-frequency dynamic viscosities and short-time self-diffusivities of random suspensions for volume fractions above the freezing point are now studied. The ASD method opens up an entire new class of suspension problems that can be investigated, including particles of non-spherical shape and a distribution of sizes, and the method can readily be extended to other low-Reynolds-number-flow problems.},

abstract = {Mechanosensing describes the ability of a cell to sense mechanical cues of its microenvironment, including not only all components of force, stress, and strain but also substrate rigidity, topology, and adhesiveness. This ability is crucial for the cell to respond to the surrounding mechanical cues and adapt to the changing environment. Examples of responses and adaptation include (de)activation, proliferation/apoptosis, and (de)differentiation. Receptor-mediated cell mechanosensing is a multistep process that is initiated by binding of cell surface receptors to their ligands on the extracellular matrix or the surface of adjacent cells. Mechanical cues are presented by the ligand and received by the receptor at the binding interface; but their transmission over space and time and their conversion into biochemical signals may involve other domains and additional molecules. In this review, a four-step model is described for the receptor-mediated cell mechanosensing process. Platelet glycoprotein Ib, T-cell receptor, and integrins are used as examples to illustrate the key concepts and players in this process.},

abstract = {Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of lipid kinases that are activated in response to various stimulants, and they regulate many processes including inflammation; the stress response; gene transcription; and cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. Increasing reports have shown that the PI3Ks and their downstream effector Akt are activated by several platelet receptors that regulate platelet activation and haemostasis. Platelets express two immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif (ITAM) receptors, collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and Fc?? receptor IIA (Fc??RIIA), which are characterized by two YxxL sequences separated by 6-12 amino acids. Activation of an ITAM receptor initiates a reaction cascade via its YxxL sequence in which signaling molecules such as spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), linker for activation of T cells (LAT) and phospholipase C ??2 (PLC??2) become activated, leading to platelet activation. Platelets also express another receptor, C-type lectin 2 (CLEC-2), which has a single YxxL sequence, so it is appropriately called a hemITAM receptor. ITAM receptors and the hemITAM receptor share many signaling features. Here we will summarize our current knowledge about how the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates (hem)ITAM receptor-mediated platelet activation and haemostasis and discuss the possible benefits of targeting PI3K/Akt as an antithrombotic therapy.},

abstract = {During clot formation, platelets are subjected to various different signals and cues as they dynamically interact with extracellular matrix proteins such as von Willebrand factor (vWF), fibrin(ogen) and collagen. While the downstream signaling of platelet-ligand interactions is well-characterized, biophysical cues, such as hydrodynamic forces and mechanical stiffness of the underlying substrate, also mediate these interactions and affect the binding kinetics of platelets to these proteins. Recent studies have observed that, similar to nucleated cells, platelets mechanosense their microenvironment and exhibit dynamic physiologic responses to biophysical cues. This review discusses how platelet mechanosensing is affected by the hydrodynamic forces that dictate vWF-platelet interactions and fibrin polymerization and network formation. The similarities and differences in mechanosensing between platelets and nucleated cells and integrin-mediated platelet mechanosensing on both fibrin(ogen) and collagen are then reviewed. Further studies investigating how platelets interact with the mechanical microenvironment will improve our overall understanding of the hemostatic process.},

abstract = {Leukocyte rolling on the endothelium via selectin molecules is an important step in the adhesion cascade, which allows leukocytes in the bloodstream to reach sites of infection. We improve upon Adhesive Dynamics simulations by incorporating deformable microvilli on which adhesion molecules are clustered. As determined in micropipette experiments, microvilli deform like an elastic spring at small forces and a combination of yield and viscous dissipation at high forces. First, we create a modified version of the state diagram for adhesion which includes microvillus deformation, and find four adhesion states-firmly bound; landing; rolling; and no-adhesion. Then, we simulate the effects of receptor clustering on the tips of microvilli, number of adhesion molecules on the cell, and the spring constant of the bonds, within the context of deformable microvilli. We also explore how the microvillus rheology itself controls the dynamics of adhesion. A minimum in rolling velocity occurs at an intermediate value of the microvillus membrane viscosity, remarkably close to the reported physiological value, suggesting that the mechanics of microvilli have evolved ideally for rolling and adhesion of leukocytes. We find that a larger degree of association between the membrane and cytoskeleton leads to slower rolling, and stiffer microvilli result in faster rolling. Decreasing the overall deformability of the microvilli greatly reduces a simulated cell's ability to roll. A comparison to experimental results of in vitro cell rolling agrees with the simulation at low shear rates. Furthermore, simulated rolling trajectories of cells with deformable microvilli display periods of rolling interdispersed with pauses, consistent with that seen in experiments where microvilli were observed to stretch. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 receptor (IGF1R)-mediated signaling plays key roles in growth, development, and physiology. Recent studies have shown that there are two distinct ig f1r genes in zebrafish, termed ig f1ra and ig f1rb. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that zebrafish ig f1ra and ig f1rb resulted from a gene duplication event at the ig f1r locus and that this has led to their functional divergence. The genomic structures of zebrafish ig f1ra and ig f1rb were determined and their loci mapped. While zebrafish ig f1ra has 21 exons and is located on linkage group (LG) 18, zebrafish ig f1rb has 22 exons and mapped to LG 7. There is a strong syntenic relationship between the two zebrafish genes and the human IG F1R gene. Using a MO-based loss-of-function approach, we show that both Igf1ra and Igf1rb are required for zebrafish embryo viability and proper growth and development. Although Igf1ra and Igf1rb demonstrated a large degree of functional overlap with regard to cell differentiation in the developing eye, inner ear, heart, and muscle, they also exhibited functional distinction involving a greater requirement for Igf1rb in spontaneous muscle contractility. These findings suggest that the duplicated zebrafish ig f1r genes play largely overlapping but not identical functional roles in early development and provide novel insight into the functional evolution of the IGF1R/insulin receptor gene family.},

Here, microcontact printing was used to immobilize human fibrinogen covalently in the form of randomly placed, micrometer-sized islands at an overall surface coverage of 20, 50, or 85{\%}. The nonprinted background region was blocked with covalently immobilized human albumin. Platelet adhesion and morphology on each substrate were assessed using combined differential interference and fluorescence microscopy. At 20{\%} coverage, most of the fibrinogen surface features were small round islands, and platelet adhesion and spreading areas were limited by the position and the size of the islands. Platelet circularity, indicated the morphology was mostly rounded. At 50{\%} coverage, some fibrinogen islands coalesced and platelet adhesion and spreading areas increased. Platelet morphology was controlled by the shape of underlying fibrinogen islands, leading to more irregular spreading. At 85{\%} coverage, the fibrinogen pattern was completely interconnected and both platelet adhesion and the spreading area were significantly higher than at lower coverage. In addition, platelets also spread over the albumin regions, suggesting that after a critical surface density of fibrinogen ligands is reached, platelet spreading is no longer inhibited by albumin. Increasing the overall fibrinogen coverage resulted in higher activation levels defined by key morphological characteristics of the spreading platelet.},

We have suggested that the role of the carbohydrate moieties in plasma proteins may have some bearing on their adsorption properties. We further suggest that lipoproteins, because of their lipid phase transition and conformational lability at body temperature, may tend to dominate the adsorption process, particularly on mobile elastomeric polymer surfaces. We suggest that detailed consideration of the structure and characteristics of each of the proteins involved is necessary in order to begin to understand plasma adsorption processes. Detailed characterization and understanding of the solid surface in the aqueous and protein environments are also required.},

abstract = {Biological adhesion is frequently mediated by specific membrane proteins (adhesion molecules). Starting with the notion of adhesion molecules, we present a simple model of the physics of membrane-to-surface attachment and detachment. This model consists of coupling the equations for deformation of an elastic membrane with equations for the chemical kinetics of the adhesion molecules. We propose a set of constitutive laws relating bond stress to bond strain and also relating the chemical rate constants of the adhesion molecules to bond strain. We derive an exact formula for the critical tension. We also describe a fast and accurate finite difference algorithm for generating numerical solutions of our model. Using this algorithm, we are able to compute the transient behaviour during the initial phases of adhesion and detachment as well as the steady-state geometry of adhesion and the velocity of the contact. An unexpected consequence of our model is the predicted occurrence of states in which adhesion cannot be reversed by application of tension. Such states occur only if the adhesion molecules have certain constitutive properties (catch-bonds). We discuss the rational for such catch-bonds and their possible biological significance. Finally, by analysis of numerical solutions, we derive an accurate and general expression for the steady-state velocity of attachment and detachment. As applications of the theory, we discuss data on the rolling velocity of granulocytes in post-capillary venules and data on lectin-mediated adhesion of red cells.},

abstract = {Platelet-type von Willebrand disease (PTVWD) is a bleeding disorder in which an increase of function mutation in glycoprotein Ibalpha (GPIbalpha), with respect to binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF), results in a loss of circulating high molecular weight VWF multimers together with a mild-moderate thrombocytopenia. To better ascertain the specific perturbations in adhesion associated with this disease state, we performed a detailed analysis of the kinetic and mechanical properties of tether bonds formed between PT-VWD platelets and the A1-domain of VWF. Results indicate that the GPIbalpha mutation, Gly233Val, promotes and stabilizes platelet adhesion to VWF at shear rates that do not support binding between the native receptor-ligand pair due to enhanced formation and increased longevity of the mutant tether bond (k0 off values for mutant versus native complex of 0.67 +/- 0.11 s-1 and 3.45 +/- 0.37 s-1, respectively). By contrast, the sensitivity of this interaction to an applied force, a measure of bond strength, was similar to the wild-type (WT) receptor. Although the observed alterations in the intrinsic properties of the GPIbalpha-VWF tether bond are comparable to those reported for the type 2B VWD, distinct molecular mechanisms may be responsible for these function-enhancing bleeding disorders, as interactions between the mutant receptor and mutant ligand resulted in a greater stability in platelet adhesion. We speculate that the enhanced cellular on-rate together with the prolongation in the lifetime of the mutant receptor-ligand bond contributes to platelet aggregation in circulating blood by permitting the formation of multiple GPIbalpha-VWF-A1 interactions.},

abstract = {Blood platelets need to undergo activation to carry out their function of stopping bleeding. Different activation degrees lead to a stepped hierarchy of responses: ability to aggregate, granule release, and, in a fraction of platelets, phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure. This suggests the existence of decision-making mechanisms in the platelet intracellular signaling network. To identify and investigate them, we developed a computational model of PAR1-stimulated platelet signal transduction that included a minimal set of major players in the calcium signaling network. The model comprised three intracellular compartments: cytosol, dense tubular system (DTS) and mitochondria and extracellular space. Computer simulations showed that the stable resting state of platelets is maintained via a balance between calcium pumps and leaks through the DTS and plasma membranes. Stimulation of PAR1 induced oscillations in the cytosolic calcium concentrations, in good agreement with experimental observations. Further increase in the agonist level activated the mitochondrial uniporter leading to calcium uptake by mitochondria, which caused the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential in a fraction of platelets leading to the PS exposure. The formation of this subpopulation was shown to be a stochastic process determined by the small number of activated PAR1 receptors and by heterogeneity in the number of ion pumps. These results demonstrate how a gradual increase of the activation degree can be converted into a stepped response hierarchy ultimately leading to formation of two distinct subpopulations from an initially homogeneous population},

This is believed to be a consequence of the complex motion of red blood cells which constitute a large fraction of the blood's volume. We use a novel lattice Boltzmann-immersed boundary method to simulate, in two dimensions, the motion of dense red blood cell suspensions and their effect on platelet-sized particles. We track the development of a red blood cell-free layer near the wall and the later development of the platelet near-wall excess. We find that the latter develops more quickly at high wall shear rates and that the magnitude of the excess and its proximity to the wall are dependent on haematocrit. Treating the simulation data as if it were generated by a drift–diffusion process, we find that the effective lateral platelet diffusivity depends strongly on lateral position; it has a magnitude of order of 10−6 cm2 s−1 over much of the lumen but drops to almost zero close to the wall. This large effective diffusivity over the core of the lumen combined with reduced space for platelets in this region because of the inward migration of red blood cells largely but not completely accounts for the observed platelet-concentration profiles. We present evidence for a highly localized red blood cell-induced platelet drift at the edge of the red cell-free layer and suggest a physical mechanism that may generate it.},

abstract = {Platelets bind to exposed vascular matrix at a wound site through a highly specialized surface receptor, glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex, which recognizes von Willebrand factor (VWF) in the matrix. GPIb-IX-V is a catch bond for it becomes more stable as force is applied to it. After attaching to the wound site, platelets generate cytoskeletal forces to compact and reinforce the hemostatic plug. Here, we evaluated the role of the GPIb-IX-V complex in the transmission of cytoskeletal forces. We used arrays of flexible, silicone nanoposts to measure the contractility of individual platelets on VWF. We found that a significant proportion of cytoskeletal forces were transmitted to VWF through GPIb-IX-V, an unexpected finding given the widely held notion that platelet forces are transmitted exclusively through its integrins. In particular, we found that the interaction between GPIb$\alpha$ and the A1 domain of VWF mediates this force transmission. We also demonstrate that the binding interaction between GPIb$\alpha$ and filamin A is involved in force transmission. Furthermore, our studies suggest that cytoskeletal forces acting through GPIb$\alpha$ are involved in maintaining platelet adhesion when external forces are absent. Thus, the GPIb-IX-V/VWF bond is able to transmit force, and uses this force to strengthen the bond through a catch-bond mechanism. This finding expands our understanding of how platelets attach to sites of vascular injury, describing a new, to the best of our knowledge, mechanism in which the catch bonds of GPIb-IX-V/VWF can be supported by internal forces produced by cytoskeletal tension.},

abstract = {While the role of platelets in hemostasis is well characterized from a biological perspective, the biophysical interactions between platelets and their mechanical microenvironment are relatively unstudied. The field of cellular mechanics has developed a number of approaches to study the effects of extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived mechanical forces on various cells, and has elucidated that integrin-cytoskeleton-mediated force transduction governs many cellular processes. As platelets adhere and spread via molecular machinery that is similar to that which enables other cells to mechanosense and mechanotransduce forces from their biophysical microenvironment, platelets too are likely governed by the same overarching mechanisms. Indeed, recent platelet mechanobiology studies have revealed that key aspects of platelet physiology and activation are regulated by the mechanical and spatial properties of the ECM microenvironment. At the same time, there are also key differences that make platelets unique in the world of cells - their size, origin as megakaryocyte fragments, and unique $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 integrin - render their mechanosensing activities particularly interesting. The structurally "simple," anucleate nature of platelets coupled with their high actin concentration (20{\%} of total protein) and integrin density [1] seem to make them ideal for mechanical force generation and transmission. Further studies will enhance our understanding of the role of platelet mechanobiology in hemostasis and thrombosis, potentially leading to new categories of diagnostics that investigate the mechanical properties of clots to determine bleeding risk, as well as therapies that target the mechanotransduction signaling pathway to alter the stability of clots. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, despite the dynamic nature of platelet adhesion, most in vitro adhesion and activation studies have focused on establishing local cause and effect relationships. Here, we determined the effect of exposing platelets to immobilized upstream human fibrinogen on downstream adhesion and activation. Microcontact printing was used to prepare substrates that contained well defined fibrinogen priming regions. Washed platelets were perfused over the substrates and adhesion and activation in a downstream capture region were compared with samples that did not contain a fibrinogen priming region. It was found that samples containing an upstream priming region resulted in higher adhesion, platelet spreading areas and aggregation than samples that lacked the priming region. Also, when the priming region was selectively blocked with a polyclonal anti-fibrinogen antibody, the platelet response was attenuated. To characterize this phenomenon further, flow cytometry was used to assess bulk platelet activation following fibrinogen priming. The expression of two activation markers, PAC-1 and P-selectin were quantified. Expression of both activation markers was found to be higher after perfusion over fibrinogen versus albumin-coated substrates. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Existing kinetic information for 77 reactions, 132 fixed kinetic rate constants, and 70 species was combined with electrochemical calculations, measurements of platelet ultrastructure, novel experimental results, and published single-cell data. The model accurately predicted: (1) steady-state resting concentrations for intracellular calcium, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; (2) transient increases in intracellular calcium, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and G(q)-GTP in response to ADP; and (3) the volume of the platelet dense tubular system. A more stringent test of the model involved stochastic simulation of individual platelets, which display an asynchronous calcium spiking behavior in response to ADP. Simulations accurately reproduced the broad frequency distribution of measured spiking events and demonstrated that asynchronous spiking was a consequence of stochastic fluctuations resulting from the small volume of the platelet. The model also provided insights into possible mechanisms of negative-feedback signaling, the relative potency of platelet agonists, and cell-to-cell variation across platelet populations. This integrative approach to platelet biology offers a novel and complementary strategy to traditional reductionist methods.},

abstract = {Leukocyte rolling on endothelial cells and other P-selectin substrates is mediated by P-selectin binding to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 expressed on the tips of leukocyte microvilli. Leukocyte rolling is a result of rapid, yet balanced formation and dissociation of selectin-ligand bonds in the presence of hydrodynamic shear forces. The hydrodynamic forces acting on the bonds may either increase (catch bonds) or decrease (slip bonds) their lifetimes. The force-dependent 'catch-slip' bond kinetics are explained using the 'two pathway model' for bond dissociation. Both the 'sliding-rebinding' and the 'allosteric' mechanisms attribute 'catch-slip' bond behavior to the force-induced conformational changes in the lectin-EGF domain hinge of selectins. Below a threshold shear stress, selectins cannot mediate rolling. This 'shear-threshold' phenomenon is a consequence of shear-enhanced tethering and catch bond-enhanced rolling. Quantitative dynamic footprinting microscopy has revealed that leukocytes rolling at venular shear stresses ({\textgreater}0.6 Pa) undergo cellular deformation (large footprint) and form long tethers. The hydrodynamic shear force and torque acting on the rolling cell are thought to be synergistically balanced by the forces acting on tethers and stressed microvilli, however, their relative contribution remains to be determined. Thus, improvement beyond the current understanding requires in silico models that can predict both cellular and microvillus deformation and experiments that allow measurement of forces acting on individual microvilli and tethers.},

Additional studies using recombinant proteins and mutant complexes confirmed its existence in GPIb-IX and enabled localization of this quasi-stable mechanosensitive domain of ∼60 residues between the macroglycopeptide region and the transmembrane helix of the GPIb$\alpha$ subunit. These results suggest that VWF-mediated pulling under fluid shear induces unfolding of the mechanosensitive domain in GPIb-IX, which may possibly contribute to platelet mechanosensing and/or shear resistance of VWF-platelet interaction. The identification of the mechanosensitive domain in GPIb-IX has significant implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of related blood diseases.},

The application of force on integrins triggers cytoskeletal rearrangements and growth of the associated adhesion complex, resulting in increased cellular stiffness, also known as reinforcement. Although RhoA has been shown to play a role during reinforcement, the molecular mechanisms that regulate its activity are unknown. By combining biochemical and biophysical approaches, we identified two guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), LARG and GEF-H1, as key molecules that regulate the cellular adaptation to force. We show that stimulation of integrins with tensional force triggers activation of these two GEFs and their recruitment to adhesion complexes. Surprisingly, activation of LARG and GEF-H1 involves distinct signalling pathways. Our results reveal that LARG is activated by the Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn, whereas GEF-H1 catalytic activity is enhanced by ERK downstream of a signalling cascade that includes FAK and Ras.},

abstract = {As platelets aggregate and activate at the site of vascular injury to stem bleeding, they are subjected to a myriad of biochemical and biophysical signals and cues. As clot formation ensues, platelets interact with polymerizing fibrin scaffolds, exposing platelets to a large range of mechanical microenvironments. Here, we show for the first time (to our knowledge) that platelets, which are anucleate cellular fragments, sense microenvironmental mechanical properties, such as substrate stiffness, and transduce those cues into differential biological signals. Specifically, as platelets mechanosense the stiffness of the underlying fibrin/fibrinogen substrate, increasing substrate stiffness leads to increased platelet adhesion and spreading. Importantly, adhesion on stiffer substrates also leads to higher levels of platelet activation, as measured by integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 activation, $\alpha$-granule secretion, and procoagulant activity. Mechanistically, we determined that Rac1 and actomyosin activity mediate substrate stiffness-dependent platelet adhesion, spreading, and activation to different degrees. This capability of platelets to mechanosense microenvironmental cues in a growing thrombus or hemostatic plug and then mechanotransduce those cues into differential levels of platelet adhesion, spreading, and activation provides biophysical insight into the underlying mechanisms of platelet aggregation and platelet activation heterogeneity during thrombus formation.},

abstract = {Platelet activation is a complex balance of positive and negative signaling pathways. The protein kinase C (PKC) family is a major regulator of platelet granule secretion, integrin activation, aggregation, spreading and procoagulant activity. As broad-spectrum PKC inhibitors reduce secretion and aggregation, the PKC family is generally considered to be a positive regulator of platelet activation. However, the individual members of the PKC family that are expressed in platelets are regulated in different ways, and an increasing body of evidence indicates that they have distinct, and often opposing, roles. Many of the recent advances in understanding the contributions of individual PKC isoforms have come from mouse gene knockout studies. PKCalpha, a classic isoform, is an essential positive regulator of granule secretion and thrombus formation, both in vitro and in vivo. Mice lacking PKCalpha show much reduced thrombus formation in vivo but do not have a bleeding defect, suggesting that PKCalpha could be an attractive antithrombotic target. Important, apparently non-redundant, roles, both positive and negative, for the novel PKC isoforms delta, theta and epsilon in granule secretion have also been proposed, indicating highly complex regulation of this essential process. Similarly, PKCbeta, PKCdelta and PKCtheta have non-redundant roles in platelet spreading, as absence of either PKCbeta or PKCtheta reduces spreading, whereas PKCdelta negatively regulates filopodial formation. This negative signaling by PKCdelta may reduce platelet aggregation and so restrict thrombus formation. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the regulation and functions of individual PKC isoforms in platelet activation and thrombus formation.},

abstract = {Hemostasis encompasses the tightly regulated processes of blood clotting, platelet activation, and vascular repair. After wounding, the hemostatic system engages a plethora of vascular and extravascular receptors that act in concert with blood components to seal off the damage inflicted to the vasculature and the surrounding tissue. The first important component that contributes to hemostasis is the coagulation system, while the second important component starts with platelet activation, which not only contributes to the hemostatic plug, but also accelerates the coagulation system. Eventually, coagulation and platelet activation are switched off by blood-borne inhibitors and proteolytic feedback loops. This review summarizes new concepts of activation of proteases that regulate coagulation and anticoagulation, to give rise to transient thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation. It further speculates on the (patho)physiological roles of intra- and extravascular receptors that operate in response to these proteases. Furthermore, this review provides a new framework for understanding how signaling and adhesive interactions between endothelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets can regulate thrombus formation and modulate the coagulation process. Now that the key molecular players of coagulation and platelet activation have become clear, and their complex interactions with the vessel wall have been mapped out, we can also better speculate on the causes of thrombosis-related angiopathies.},

abstract = {Wall shear stress in postcapillary venules varies widely within and between tissues and in re-sponse to inflammation and exercise. However, the speed at which leukocytes roll in vivo has been shown to be almost constant within a wide range of wall shear stress, i.e., force on the cell. Similarly, rolling velocities on purified selectins and their ligands in vitro tend to plateau. This may be important to enable rolling leuko-cytes to be exposed uniformly to activating stimuli on endothelium, independent of local hemodynamic con-ditions. Wall shear stress increases the rate of dissocia-tion of individual selectin–ligand tether bonds expo-nentially (1, 4) thereby destabilizing rolling. We find that this is compensated by a shear-dependent increase in the number of bonds per rolling step. We also find an increase in the number of microvillous tethers to the substrate. This explains (a) the lack of firm adhesion through selectins at low shear stress or high ligand den-sity, and (b) the stability of rolling on selectins to wide variation in wall shear stress and ligand density, in con-trast to rolling on antibodies (14). Furthermore, our data successfully predict the threshold wall shear stress below which rolling does not occur. This is a special case of the more general regulation by shear of the number of bonds, in which the number of bonds falls below one.},

abstract = {Many experiments have measured the effect of force on the dissociation of single selectin bonds, but it is not yet clear how the force dependence of molecular dissociation can influence the rolling of cells expressing selectin molecules. Recent experiments using constant-force atomic force microscopy or high-resolution microscopic observations of pause-time distributions of cells in a flow chamber show that for some bonds, the dissociation rate is high at low force and initially decreases with force, indicating a catch bond. As the force continues to increase, the dissociation rate increases again, like a slip bond. It has been proposed that this catch-slip bond leads to the shear threshold effect, in which a certain level of shear rate is required to achieve rolling. We have incorporated a catch-slip dissociation rate into adhesive dynamics simulations of cell rolling. Using a relatively simple model for the shear-controlled association rate for selectin bonds, we were able to recreate characteristics of the shear threshold effect seen most prominently for rolling through L-selectin. The rolling velocity as a function of shear rate showed a minimum near 100 s-1. Furthermore, cells were observed to roll at a shear rate near the threshold, but detach and move more quickly when the shear rate was dropped below the threshold. Finally, using adhesive dynamics, we were able to determine ranges of parameters necessary to see the shear threshold effect in the rolling velocity. In summary, we found through simulation that the catch-slip behavior of selectin bonds can be responsible for the shear threshold effect. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Flow-enhanced cell adhesion is an unexplained phenomenon that might result from a transport-dependent increase in on-rates or a force-dependent decrease in off-rates of adhesive bonds. L-selectin requires a threshold shear to support leukocyte rolling on P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and other vascular ligands. Low forces decrease L-selectin-PSGL-1 off-rates (catch bonds), whereas higher forces increase off-rates (slip bonds). We determined that a force-dependent decrease in off-rates dictated flow-enhanced rolling of L-selectin-bearing microspheres or neutrophils on PSGL-1. Catch bonds enabled increasing force to convert short-lived tethers into longer-lived tethers, which decreased rolling velocities and increased the regularity of rolling steps as shear rose from the threshold to an optimal value. As shear increased above the optimum, transitions to slip bonds shortened tether lifetimes, which increased rolling velocities and decreased rolling regularity. Thus, force-dependent alterations of bond lifetimes govern L-selectin-dependent cell adhesion below and above the shear optimum. These findings establish the first biological function for catch bonds as a mechanism for flow-enhanced cell adhesion.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in neuron–glia communication. This interest stems from the realization that glia participate in cognitive functions and information processing and are involved in many brain disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. An important process in neuron–glia communications is astrocyte encoding of synaptic information transfer—the modulation of intracellular calcium (Ca2 + ) dynamics in astrocytes in response to synaptic activity. Here, we derive and investigate a concise mathematical model for glutamate-induced astrocytic intracellular Ca2 +  dynamics that captures the essential biochemical features of the regulatory pathway of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Starting from the well-known two-variable (intracellular Ca2 +  and inactive IP3 receptors) Li–Rinzel model for calcium-induced calcium release, we incorporate the regulation of IP3 production and phosphorylation. Doing so, we extend it to a three-variable model (which we refer to as the ChI model) that could account for Ca2 +  oscillations with endogenous IP3 metabolism. This ChI model is then further extended into the G-ChI model to include regulation of IP3 production by external glutamate signals. Compared with previous similar models, our three-variable models include a more realistic description of IP3 production and degradation pathways, lumping together their essential nonlinearities within a concise formulation. Using bifurcation analysis and time simulations, we demonstrate the existence of new putative dynamical features. The cross-couplings between IP3 and Ca2 +  pathways endow the system with self-consistent oscillatory properties and favor mixed frequency–amplitude encoding modes over pure amplitude–modulation ones. These and additional results of our model are in general agreement with available experimental data and may have important implications for the role of astrocytes in the synaptic transfer of information.},

We have developed the Leukotrack program that incorporates a novel (to our knowledge) segmentation routine capable of reliable detection of cells in phase contrast images. The program also automatically tracks rolling cells in addition to those that are more firmly attached and migrating in random directions. We demonstrate its use in the analysis of lymphocyte arrest mediated by one or more active conformations of the integrin LFA-1. Activation of LFA-1 is a multistep process that depends on several proteins including kindlin-3, the protein that is mutated in leukocyte adhesion deficiency-III patients. We find that the very first stage of LFA-1-mediated attaching is unable to proceed in the absence of kindlin-3. Our evidence indicates that kindlin-3-mediated high-affinity LFA-1 controls both the early transient integrin-dependent adhesions in addition to the final stable adhesions made under flow conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Resting platelets maintain a stable level of low cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) and high dense tubular system calcium ([Ca2+]dts). During thrombosis, activators cause a transient rise in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) to trigger calcium mobilization from stores and elevation of [Ca2+]cyt. Another major source of [Ca2+]cyt elevation is store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through plasmalemmal calcium channels that open in response to store depletion as [Ca2+]dts drops. A 34-species systems model employed kinetics describing IP3-receptor, DTS-plasmalemma puncta formation, SOCE via assembly of STIM1 and Orai1, and the plasmalemma and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases. Four constraints were imposed: calcium homeostasis before activation; stable in zero extracellular calcium; IP3-activatable; and functional SOCE. Using a Monte Carlo method to sample three unknown parameters and nine initial concentrations in a 12-dimensional space near measured or expected values, we found that model configurations that were responsive to stimuli and demonstrated significant SOCE required high inner membrane electric potential ({\textgreater}-70 mV) and low resting IP3 concentrations. The absence of puncta in resting cells was required to prevent spontaneous store depletion in calcium-free media. Ten-fold increases in IP3 caused saturated calcium mobilization. This systems model represents a critical step in being able to predict platelets' phenotypes during hemostasis or thrombosis. ?? 2014 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The regulated ability of integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 to bind fibrinogen plays a crucial role in platelet aggregation and hemostasis. We have developed a model system based on laser tweezers, enabling us to measure specific rupture forces needed to separate single receptor-ligand complexes. First of all, we performed a thorough and statistically representative analysis of nonspecific protein-protein binding versus specific $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-fibrinogen interactions in combination with experimental evidence for single-molecule measurements. The rupture force distribution of purified $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 and fibrinogen, covalently attached to underlying surfaces, ranged from ∼20 to 150pN. This distribution could be fit with a sum of an exponential curve for weak to moderate (20–60pN) forces, and a Gaussian curve for strong ({\textgreater}60pN) rupture forces that peaked at 80–90pN. The interactions corresponding to these rupture force regimes differed in their susceptibility to $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 antagonists or Mn2+, an $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 activator. Varying the surface density of fibrinogen changed the total binding probability linearly {\textgreater}3.5-fold but did not affect the shape of the rupture force distribution, indicating that the measurements represent single-molecule binding. The yield strength of $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-fibrinogen interactions was independent of the loading rate (160–16,000pN/s), whereas their binding probability markedly correlated with the duration of contact. The aggregate of data provides evidence for complex multi-step binding/unbinding pathways of $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 and fibrinogen revealed at the single-molecule level.},

abstract = {The receptor-mediated adhesion of cells to ligand-coated surfaces in viscous shear flow is an important step in many physiological processes, such as the neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response, lymphocyte homing, and tumor cell metastasis. This paper describes a calculational method which simulates the interaction of a single cell with a ligand-coated surface under flow. The cell is idealized as a microvilli-coated hard sphere covered with adhesive springs. The distribution of microvilli on the cell surface, the distribution of receptors on microvilli tips, and the forward and reverse reaction between receptor and ligand are all simulated using random number sampling of appropriate probability functions. The velocity of the cell at each time step in the simulation results from a balance of hydrodynamic, colloidal and bonding forces; the bonding force is derived by summing the individual contributions of each receptor-ligand tether. The model can simulate the effect of many parameters on adhesion, such as the number of receptors on microvilli tips, the density of ligand, the rates of reaction between receptor and ligand, the stiffness of the resulting receptor-ligand springs, the response of springs to strain, and the magnitude of the bulk hydrodynamic stresses. The model can successfully recreate the entire range of expected and observed adhesive phenomena, from completely unencumbered motion, to rolling, to transient attachment, to firm adhesion. Also, the method can generate meaningful statistical measures of adhesion, including the mean and variance in velocity, rate constants for cell attachment and detachment, and the frequency of adhesion. We find a critical modulating parameter of adhesion is the fractional spring slippage, which relates the strain of a bond to its rate of breakage; the higher the slippage, the faster the breakage for the same strain. Our analysis of neutrophil adhesive behavior on selectin-coated (CD62-coated) surfaces in viscous shear flow reported by Lawrence and Springer (Lawrence, M.B., and T.A. Springer 1991. Cell. 65:859–874) shows the fractional spring slippage of the CD62-LECAM-1 bond is likely below 0.01. We conclude the unique ability of this selectin bond to cause neutrophil rolling under flow is a result of its unique response to strain. Furthermore, our model can successfully recreate data on neutrophil rolling as function of CD62 surface density. {\textcopyright} 1992, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The interaction of fibrinogen with the integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 plays a crucial role in platelet adhesion and platelet activation leading to the generation of intracellular signals that nucleate the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Presently, we have only a limited understanding of the signaling cascades and effector proteins through which changes in the cytoskeletal architecture are mediated. The present study identifies phospholipase C$\gamma$2 (PLC$\gamma$2) as an important target of the Src-dependent signaling cascade regulated by $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3. Real time phasecontrast microscopy is used to show that formation of filopodia and lamellapodia in murine platelets on a fibrinogen surface is dramatically inhibited in the absence of PLC$\gamma$2. Significantly, the formation of these structures is mediated by Ca2+ elevation and activation of protein kinase C, both directly regulated by PLC activity. With the involvement of Syk, SLP-76, and Btk, $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-induced PLC$\gamma$2 activation partly overlaps with the pathway used by the collagen receptor glycoprotein VI. Important differences, however, exist between the two signaling cascades in that activation of PLC$\gamma$2 by $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 is unaltered in murine platelets, which lack the FcR $\gamma$-chain or the adaptor LAT, but is abolished in the presence of cytochalasin D. Therefore, PLC$\gamma$2 plays not only a crucial role in activation of $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 by collagen receptors but also in $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-mediated responses. },

Although the biochemical signalings of platelet-collagen interactions have been well characterized, little is known about the role microenvironmental biomechanical properties, such as vascular wall stiffness, may have on clot formation. To that end, we investigated how substrates of varying stiffness conjugated with the same concentration of Type I collagen affect platelet adhesion, spreading, and activation. Using collagen-conjugated polyacrylamide (PA) gels of different stiffnesses, we observed that platelets do in fact mechanotransduce the stiffness cues of collagen substrates, manifesting in increased platelet spreading on stiffer substrates. In addition, increasing substrate stiffness also increases phosphatidylserine exposure, a key aspect of platelet activation that initiates coagulation on the platelet surface. Mechanistically, these collagen substrate stiffness effects are mediated by extracellular calcium levels and actomyosin pathways driven by myosin light chain kinase but not Rho-associated protein kinase. Overall, our results improve our understanding of how the mechanics of different tissues and stroma affect clot formation, what role the increased vessel wall stiffness in atherosclerosis may directly have on thrombosis leading to heart attacks and strokes, and how age-related increased vessel wall stiffness affects hemostasis and thrombosis.},

abstract = {Recent experimental and theoretical work clarifying the physical chemistry of blood-protein adsorption from aqueous-buffer solution to various kinds of surfaces is reviewed and interpreted within the context of biomaterial applications, especially toward development of cardiovascular biomaterials. The importance of this subject in biomaterials surface science is emphasized by reducing the "protein-adsorption problem" to three core questions that require quantitative answer. An overview of the protein-adsorption literature identifies some of the sources of inconsistency among many investigators participating in more than five decades of focused research. A tutorial on the fundamental biophysical chemistry of protein adsorption sets the stage for a detailed discussion of the kinetics and thermodynamics of protein adsorption, including adsorption competition between two proteins for the same adsorbent immersed in a binary-protein mixture. Both kinetics and steady-state adsorption can be rationalized using a single interpretive paradigm asserting that protein molecules partition from solution into a three-dimensional (3D) interphase separating bulk solution from the physical-adsorbent surface. Adsorbed protein collects in one-or-more adsorbed layers, depending on protein size, solution concentration, and adsorbent surface energy (water wettability). The adsorption process begins with the hydration of an adsorbent surface brought into contact with an aqueous-protein solution. Surface hydration reactions instantaneously form a thin, pseudo-2D interface between the adsorbent and protein solution. Protein molecules rapidly diffuse into this newly formed interface, creating a truly 3D interphase that inflates with arriving proteins and fills to capacity within milliseconds at mg/mL bulk-solution concentrations C B. This inflated interphase subsequently undergoes time-dependent (minutes-to-hours) decrease in volume V I by expulsion of either-or-both interphase water and initially adsorbed protein. Interphase protein concentration C I increases as V I decreases, resulting in slow reduction in interfacial energetics. Steady state is governed by a net partition coefficient P=(C I/C B). In the process of occupying space within the interphase, adsorbing protein molecules must displace an equivalent volume of interphase water. Interphase water is itself associated with surface-bound water through a network of transient hydrogen bonds. Displacement of interphase water thus requires an amount of energy that depends on the adsorbent surface chemistry/energy. This "adsorption-dehydration" step is the significant free energy cost of adsorption that controls the maximum amount of protein that can be adsorbed at steady state to a unit adsorbent surface area (the adsorbent capacity). As adsorbent hydrophilicity increases, adsorbent capacity monotonically decreases because the energetic cost of surface dehydration increases, ultimately leading to no protein adsorption near an adsorbent water wettability (surface energy) characterized by a water contact angle $\theta$→65 °. Consequently, protein does not adsorb (accumulate at interphase concentrations greater than bulk solution) to more hydrophilic adsorbents exhibiting $\theta${\textless}65 °. For adsorbents bearing strong Lewis acid/base chemistry such as ion-exchange resins, protein/surface interactions can be highly favorable, causing protein to adsorb in multilayers in a relatively thick interphase. A straightforward, three-component free energy relationship captures salient features of protein adsorption to all surfaces predicting that the overall free energy of protein adsorption $\Delta$Gadso is a relatively small multiple of thermal energy for any surface chemistry (except perhaps for bioengineered surfaces bearing specific ligands for adsorbing protein) because a surface chemistry that interacts chemically with proteins must also interact with water through hydrogen bonding. In this way, water moderates protein adsorption to any surface by competing with adsorbing protein molecules. This Leading Opinion ends by proposing several changes to the protein-adsorption paradigm that might advance answers to the three core questions that frame the "protein-adsorption problem" that is so fundamental to biomaterials surface science. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {While the role of platelets in hemostasis is well characterized from a biological perspective, the biophysical interactions between platelets and their mechanical microenvironment are relatively unstudied. The field of cellular mechanics has developed a number of approaches to study the effects of extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived mechanical forces on various cells, and has elucidated that integrin-cytoskeleton-mediated force transduction governs many cellular processes. As platelets adhere and spread via molecular machinery that is similar to that which enables other cells to mechanosense and mechanotransduce forces from their biophysical microenvironment, platelets too are likely governed by the same overarching mechanisms. Indeed, recent platelet mechanobiology studies have revealed that key aspects of platelet physiology and activation are regulated by the mechanical and spatial properties of the ECM microenvironment. At the same time, there are also key differences that make platelets unique in the world of cells - their size, origin as megakaryocyte fragments, and unique $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 integrin - render their mechanosensing activities particularly interesting. The structurally "simple," anucleate nature of platelets coupled with their high actin concentration (20{\%} of total protein) and integrin density [1] seem to make them ideal for mechanical force generation and transmission. Further studies will enhance our understanding of the role of platelet mechanobiology in hemostasis and thrombosis, potentially leading to new categories of diagnostics that investigate the mechanical properties of clots to determine bleeding risk, as well as therapies that target the mechanotransduction signaling pathway to alter the stability of clots. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Cells govern tissue shape by exerting highly regulated forces at sites of matrix adhesion. As the major force-bearing adhesion-receptor protein, integrins have a central role in how cells sense and respond to the mechanics of their surroundings. Recent studies have shown that a key aspect of mechanotransduction is the cycle by which integrins bind to the matrix at the leading cell edge, attach to the cytoskeleton, transduce mechanical force, aggregate in the plasma membrane as part of increasingly strengthened adhesion complexes, unbind and, ultimately, are recycled. This mechanical cycle enables the transition from early complexes to larger, more stable adhesions that can then rapidly release. Within this mechanical cycle, integrins themselves exhibit intramolecular conformational change that regulates their binding affinity and may also be dependent upon force. How the cell integrates these dynamic elements into a rigidity response is not clear. Here, we focus on the steps in the integrin mechanical cycle that are sensitive to force and closely linked to integrin function, such as the lateral alignment of integrin aggregates and related adhesion components.},

This work focuses on the mechanical part, including the constitutive model (proposing some modifications to pre-existent models), the numerical scheme and the coupling strategy. The model is next assessed through two examples. First, the simulation of a small piece of cardiac tissue is used to introduce the main features of the coupled model and calibrate its parameters against experimental evidence. Then, a more realistic prob- lem is solved using those parameters, with a mesh of the Oxford ventricular rabbit model.

abstract = {Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) has been proposed as the main process controlling Ca2+ entry in non-excitable cells. Although recent breakthroughs in experimental studies of SOCE have been made, its mathematical modeling has not been developed. In the present work, SOCE is viewed as a feedback control system subject to an extracellular agonist disturbance and an extracellular calcium input. We then design a dynamic output feedback controller to reject the disturbance and track Ca2+ resting levels in the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The constructed feedback control system is validated by published experimental data and its global asymptotic stability is proved by using the LaSalle's invariance principle. We then simulate the dynamic responses of STIM1 and Orai1, two major components in the operation of the store-operated channels, to the depletion of Ca2+ in the ER with thapsigargin, which show that: (1) Upon the depletion of Ca2+ in the ER, the concentrations of activated STIM1 and STIM1-Orai1 cluster are elevated gradually, indicating that STIM1 is accumulating in the ER-PM junctions and that the cytosolic portion of the active STIM1 is binding to Orai1 and driving the opening of CRAC channels for Ca2+ entry; (2) after the extracellular Ca2+ addition, the concentrations of both STIM1 and STIM1-Orai1 cluster decrease but still much higher than the original levels. We also simulate the system responses to the agonist disturbance, which show that, when a sequence of periodic agonist pulses is applied, the system returns to its equilibrium after each pulse. This indicates that the designed feedback controller can reject the disturbance and track the equilibrium. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Thrombin, one of the major proteases in the coagulation cascade, activates protease activated receptors 1 and 4 (PAR 1 and PAR4) to generate a network of intracellular signals that lead to stable platelet aggregation. Abnormal platelet activation could lead to either thrombosis or bleeding disorders, thus a predictive model of platelet activation would be an invaluable tool for the study of platelet function. In this work, we developed a computational model of PAR1-stimulated human platelet activation fully based on experimental observations. The model is represented by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the kinetics of the interacting components. The model is able to reproduce experimental dose responses and time-courses of cytosolic calcium (Ca(2+)), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), diacylglycerol (DAG), GTP-bound Ras-proximate-1 (Rap1GTP), secretion of dense-granules, and activation of integrin $\alpha$2b$\beta$3 (GPIIbIIIa). Because of the inherent complexity of such a model, we also provide a simple way to identify and divide the system into interlinked functional modules to reduce the number of unknown parameters. Both the full and the reduced kinetic models are shown to predict platelet behavior in response to PAR1 activation.},

abstract = {Cell motility proceeds by cycles of edge protrusion, adhesion, and retraction. Whether these functions are coordinated by biochemical or biomechanical processes is unknown. We find that myosin II pulls the rear of the lamellipodial actin network, causing upward bending, edge retraction, and initiation of new adhesion sites. The network then separates from the edge and condenses over the myosin. Protrusion resumes as lamellipodial actin regenerates from the front and extends rearward until it reaches newly assembled myosin, initiating the next cycle. Upward bending, observed by evanescence and electron microscopy, results in ruffle formation when adhesion strength is low. Correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy shows that the regenerating lamellipodium forms a cohesive, separable layer of actin above the lamellum. Thus, actin polymerization periodically builds a mechanical link, the lamellipodium, connecting myosin motors with the initiation of adhesion sites, suggesting that the major functions driving motility are coordinated by a biomechanical process. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {During vascular injury, platelets adhere to exposed subendothelial proteins, such as collagen, on the blood vessel walls to trigger clot formation. Although the biochemical signalings of platelet-collagen interactions have been well characterized, little is known about the role microenvironmental biomechanical properties, such as vascular wall stiffness, may have on clot formation. To that end, we investigated how substrates of varying stiffness conjugated with the same concentration of Type I collagen affect platelet adhesion, spreading, and activation. Using collagen-conjugated polyacrylamide (PA) gels of different stiffnesses, we observed that platelets do in fact mechanotransduce the stiffness cues of collagen substrates, manifesting in increased platelet spreading on stiffer substrates. In addition, increasing substrate stiffness also increases phosphatidylserine exposure, a key aspect of platelet activation that initiates coagulation on the platelet surface. Mechanistically, these collagen substrate stiffness effects are mediated by extracellular calcium levels and actomyosin pathways driven by myosin light chain kinase but not Rho-associated protein kinase. Overall, our results improve our understanding of how the mechanics of different tissues and stroma affect clot formation, what role the increased vessel wall stiffness in atherosclerosis may directly have on thrombosis leading to heart attacks and strokes, and how age-related increased vessel wall stiffness affects hemostasis and thrombosis.},

abstract = {Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing proteins have recently been demonstrated in macrophages and neutrophils to be required for cell surface integrins to transmit activation signals into the cell. To identify ITAM-bearing proteins that mediate signaling via the platelet-specific integrin alphaIIbbeta3, fibrinogen binding was induced by (1) allowing platelets to spread directly on immobilized fibrinogen, or (2) activating the PAR1 thrombin receptor on platelets in suspension. Both initiated strong, ligand binding-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM-bearing platelet Fc receptor, FcgammaRIIa, as well as downstream phosphorylation of the protein tyrosine kinase Syk and activation of phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2). Addition of Fab fragments of an FcgammaRIIa-specific monoclonal antibody strongly inhibited platelet spreading on immobilized fibrinogen, as well as downstream tyrosine phosphorylation of FcgammaRIIa, Syk, and PLCgamma2, and platelets from a patient whose platelets express reduced levels of FcgammaRIIa exhibited markedly reduced spreading on immobilized fibrinogen. Finally, fibrinogen binding-induced FcgammaRIIa phosphorylation did not occur in human platelets expressing a truncated beta3 cytoplasmic domain. Taken together, these data suggest that ligand binding to platelet alphaIIbbeta3 induces integrin cytoplasmic domain-dependent phosphorylation of FcgammaRIIa, which then enlists selected components of the immunoreceptor signaling cascade to transmit amplification signals into the cell.},

abstract = {The impact of flow disturbances on platelet adhesion is complex and incompletely understood. At the molecular scale, platelet glycoprotein Ib$\alpha$ (GPIb$\alpha$) must associate with the von Willebrand factor A1 domain (VWF-A1) with a rapid on-rate under high hemodynamic forces, as occurs in arterial thrombosis, where various transport mechanisms are at work. Here, we theoretically modeled the coupled transport-reaction process of the two-dimensional (2D) receptor-ligand association kinetics in a biomembrane force probe to explicitly account for the effects of molecular length, confinement stiffness, medium viscosity, surface curvature, and separation distance. We experimentally verified the theoretical approach by visualizing association and dissociation of individual VWF-A1-GPIb$\alpha$ bonds in a real-time thermal fluctuation assay. The apparent on-rate, reciprocal of the average time intervals between sequential bonds, decreased with the increasing gap distance between A1- and GPIb$\alpha$-bearing surfaces with an 80-nm threshold (beyond which bond formation became prohibitive) identified as the combined contour length of the receptor and ligand molecules. The biomembrane force probe spring constant and diffusivity of the protein-bearing beads also significantly influenced the apparent on-rate, in accordance with the proposed transport mechanisms. The global agreement between the experimental data and the model predictions supports the hypothesis that receptor-ligand association behaves distinctly in the transport- and reaction-limited scenarios. To our knowledge, our results represent the first detailed quantification of physical regulation of the 2D on-rate that allows platelets to sense and respond to local changes in their hemodynamic environment. In addition, they provide an approach for determining the intrinsic kinetic parameters that employs simultaneous experimental measurements and theoretical modeling of bond association in a single assay. The 2D intrinsic forward rate for VWF-A1-GPIb$\alpha$ association was determined from the measurements to be (3.5 ± 0.67) × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-4{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} $\mu$m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.},

abstract = {Platelets are involved in life-sustaining processes such as hemostasis, wound healing, atherothrombosis and angiogenesis. Mechanical trauma to blood vessels causes platelet activation resulting in their adherence and clot formation at the damaged site, culminating in clot retraction and tissue repair. Two of the major players underlying this process are the cytoskeleton, i.e., actin and microtubules, and the membrane integrin receptors. Rare congenital bleeding disorders such as Glanzmann thrombasthenia and Bernard-Soulier syndrome are associated with genetic alterations of platelet surface receptors, also affecting the platelet cytoskeletal structure. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about platelet structure and adhesion, and delve into the mechanical aspects of platelet function. Platelets lack a nucleus, and can thus provide a minimal model of a biological cell. New biophysical tools may help to scrutinize platelets anew and to extend the existing knowledge on cell biology.},

abstract = {Binding of receptor proteins on circulating platelets to fibrinogen adsorbed on a biomaterial surface is a critical event in the blood-material interactions and surface-induced thrombogenesis. In this work, the interactions between purified platelet membrane integrin GPIIbIIIa (??IIb??3) and fibrinogen on model hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces were characterized by measuring ligand-receptor debonding forces by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Force profiles between AFM probes functionalized with platelet integrins and fibrinogen on these substrates showed multiple rupture events over large distances on both surfaces. On the hydrophobic surface, the rupture length range was 20-200 nm, whereas on the hydrophilic surface, the rupture length range was 20-400 nm. Rupture events in the force curves were found to arise from non-specific protein-protein interactions, mechanical denaturation of fibrinogen domains, as well as the specific ligand-receptor interactions between integrins and fibrinogen. Analysis of the distributions of the debonding forces was used to estimate the strength of single integrin-fibrinogen pair at different loading rates. For loading rates of 10-60 nN/s, the debonding strength of a single integrin-fibrinogen pair was found to be in the range of 50-80 pN and was independent of the underlying substrate. Results suggest that once the active platelet binding epitope in fibrinogen becomes exposed by surface adsorption, binding of the platelet membrane integrin receptor will be similar regardless of the material surface properties. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Rolling adhesion on vascular surfaces is the first step in recruiting circulating leukocytes, hematopoietic progenitors, or platelets to specific organs or to sites of infection or injury. Rolling requires the rapid yet balanced formation and dissociation of adhesive bonds in the challenging environment of blood flow. This review explores how structurally distinct adhesion receptors interact through mechanically regulated kinetics with their ligands to meet these challenges. Remarkably, increasing force applied to adhesive bonds first prolongs their lifetimes (catch bonds) and then shortens their lifetimes (slip bonds). Catch bonds mediate the counterintuitive phenomenon of flow-enhanced rolling adhesion. Force-regulated disruptions of receptor interdomain or intradomain interactions remote from the ligand-binding surface generate catch bonds. Adhesion receptor dimerization, clustering in membrane domains, and interactions with the cytoskeleton modulate the forces applied to bonds. Both inside-out and outside-in cell signals regulate these processes.},

abstract = {Using a combined experimental and theoretical approach named binding-unbinding correlation spectroscopy (BUCS), we describe the two-dimensional kinetics of interactions between fibrinogen and the integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3, the ligand-receptor pair essential for platelet function during hemostasis and thrombosis. The methodology uses the optical trap to probe force-free association of individual surface-attached fibrinogen and $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 molecules and forced dissociation of an $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-fibrinogen complex. This novel approach combines force clamp measurements of bond lifetimes with the binding mode to quantify the dependence of the binding probability on the interaction time. We found that fibrinogen-reactive $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 pre-exists in at least two states that differ in their zero force on-rates (k(on1) = 1.4 × 10(-4) and k(on2) = 2.3 × 10(-4) $\mu$m(2)/s), off-rates (k(off1) = 2.42 and k(off2) = 0.60 s(-1)), and dissociation constants (K(d)(1) = 1.7 × 10(4) and K(d)(2) = 2.6 × 10(3) $\mu$m(-2)). The integrin activator Mn(2+) changed the on-rates and affinities (K(d)(1) = 5 × 10(4) and K(d)(2) = 0.3 × 10(3) $\mu$m(-2)) but did not affect the off-rates. The strength of $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-fibrinogen interactions was time-dependent due to a progressive increase in the fraction of the high affinity state of the $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-fibrinogen complex characterized by a faster on-rate. Upon Mn(2+)-induced integrin activation, the force-dependent off-rates decrease while the complex undergoes a conformational transition from a lower to higher affinity state. The results obtained provide quantitative estimates of the two-dimensional kinetic rates for the low and high affinity $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 and fibrinogen interactions at the single molecule level and offer direct evidence for the time- and force-dependent changes in $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 conformation and ligand binding activity, underlying the dynamics of fibrinogen-mediated platelet adhesion and aggregation.},

abstract = {Antiplatelet treatment is of fundamental importance in combatting functions/dysfunction of platelets in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. Dysfunction of anucleate platelets is likely to be completely attributable to alterations in posttranslational modifications and protein expression. We therefore examined the proteome of platelets highly purified from fresh blood donations, using elaborate protocols to ensure negligible contamination by leukocytes, erythrocytes, and plasma. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we created the first comprehensive and quantitative human platelet proteome, comprising almost 4000 unique proteins, estimated copy numbers for ∼ 3700 of those, and assessed intersubject (4 donors) as well as intrasubject (3 different blood samples from 1 donor) variations of the proteome. For the first time, our data allow for a systematic and weighted appraisal of protein networks and pathways in human platelets, and indicate the feasibility of differential and comprehensive proteome analyses from small blood donations. Because 85{\%} of the platelet proteome shows no variation between healthy donors, this study represents the starting point for disease-oriented platelet proteomics. In the near future, comprehensive and quantitative comparisons between normal and well-defined dysfunctional platelets, or between platelets obtained from donors at various stages of chronic cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases will be feasible.},

@article{Hammer1987,
abstract = {We present a dynamical model for receptor-mediated adhesion of cells in a shear field of viscous fluid to surfaces coated with ligand molecules complementary to receptors in the cell membrane. We refer to this model as the "point attachment model" because it considers the contact area between the cell and the surface to be a small, homogeneous region that mediates the initial attachment of the cell to the surface. Using a phase plane analysis of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which govern the changes in free receptor density and bond density within the contact area with time, we can predict the conditions for which adhesion between the cell and the surface will take place. Whether adhesion occurs depends on values of dimensionless quantities that characterize the interaction of the cell and its receptors with the surface and its ligand, such as the bond formation rate, the receptor-ligand affinity, the fluid mechanical force, the receptor mobility, and the contact area. A key result is that there are two regimes in which different chemical and physical forces dominate: a rate-controlled high affinity regime and an affinity-controlled low-affinity regime. Many experimental observations can be explained by understanding which of these regimes is appropriate. We also provide simple approximate analytical solutions, relating adhesiveness to cell and surface properties as well as fluid forces, which allow convenient testing of model predictions by experiment. {\textcopyright} 1987, The Biophysical Society.

abstract = {Upon vascular injury, platelets are activated by adhesion to adhesive proteins, such as von Willebrand factor and collagen, or by soluble platelet agonists, such as ADP, thrombin, and thromboxane A(2). These adhesive proteins and soluble agonists induce signal transduction via their respective receptors. The various receptor-specific platelet activation signaling pathways converge into common signaling events that stimulate platelet shape change and granule secretion and ultimately induce the "inside-out" signaling process leading to activation of the ligand-binding function of integrin $\alpha$(IIb)$\beta$(3). Ligand binding to integrin $\alpha$(IIb)$\beta$(3) mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation and triggers "outside-in" signaling, resulting in platelet spreading, additional granule secretion, stabilization of platelet adhesion and aggregation, and clot retraction. It has become increasingly evident that agonist-induced platelet activation signals also cross talk with integrin outside-in signals to regulate platelet responses. Platelet activation involves a series of rapid positive feedback loops that greatly amplify initial activation signals and enable robust platelet recruitment and thrombus stabilization. Recent studies have provided novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of these processes.},

abstract = {Src tyrosine kinases transmit integrin-dependent signals pivotal for cell movement and proliferation. Here, we establish a mechanism for Src activation by integrins. c-Src is shown to bind constitutively and selectively to beta3 integrins through an interaction involving the c-Src SH3 domain and the carboxyl-terminal region of the beta3 cytoplasmic tail. Clustering of beta3 integrins in vivo activates c-Src and induces phosphorylation of Tyr-418 in the c-Src activation loop, a reaction essential for adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of Syk, a c-Src substrate. Unlike c-Src, Hck, Lyn, and c-Yes bind more generally to beta1A, beta2, and beta3 cytoplasmic tails. These results invoke a model whereby Src is primed for activation by direct interaction with an integrin beta tail, and integrin clustering stabilizes activated Src by inducing intermolecular autophosphorylation. The data provide a paradigm for integrin regulation of Src and a molecular basis for the similar functional defects of osteoclasts or platelets from mice lacking beta3 integrins or c-Src.},

Understanding the complex interplay between activatory and inhibitory signaling networks is an emerging challenge in the study of platelet biology and necessitates a systematic approach to utilize experimental data effectively. In this review, we will explore the key points of platelet regulation and signaling that maintain platelets in a resting state, mediate activation to elicit thrombus formation or provide negative feedback.

We report on an algorithm that tracks platelets using the output of such flow run experiments, taking into account common artifacts encountered by previously-published methods, and we derive seven key metrics of platelet dynamics that can be used to characterize platelet function. Extensive testing of our method using simulated platelet flow run data was carried out to validate our tracking method and derived metrics in capturing key platelet-vWF interaction-dynamics properties. Our results show that while the number of platelets present on the imaged area is the leading cause of errors, flow run data from two experiments using whole blood samples showed that our method and metrics can detect platelet property changes/differences that are concordant with the expected biological outcome, such as inhibiting key platelet receptors such as P2Y1, glycoprotein (GP)Ib and GPIIb/IIIa.

@article{Shakhidzhanov2015,
abstract = {Background: Two major soluble blood platelet activators are thrombin and ADP. Of these two, only thrombin can induce mitochondrial collapse and programmed cell death leading to phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure required for blood clotting reactions acceleration. Thrombin can also greatly potentiate collagen-induced PS exposure. However, ADP acting through the P2Y12 receptor was shown to increase the PS-exposing (PS+) platelets fraction produced by thrombin or thrombin-plus-collagen via an unknown mechanism. Methods: Wedeveloped a comprehensive multicompartmental computational model of platelet PAR1-and-P2Y12 calciumsignal transduction that included cytoplasmic signaling, dense tubular systemand mitochondria. To test model predictions, flow cytometry experiments with washed, annexin V-labeled platelets were performed. Results: Stimulation of thrombin receptor PAR1 in the model induced cytoplasmic calcium oscillations, calcium uptake by mitochondria, opening of the permeability transition pore and collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. ADP stimulation of P2Y12 led to cAMP decrease that, in turn, caused changes in phospholipase C phosphorylation by protein kinase A, increase in cytoplasmic calciumlevel and, consequently, PS+ platelet formation. ADP addition before stimulation of PAR1 produced much greater increase of the PS+ fraction because cAMP concentration had time to go down prior to calcium oscillations; this prediction was also tested and confirmed experimentally. Conclusion: These results suggest amechanismof ADP-dependent PS exposure regulation and showa likelymode of action that could be important for the PS exposure regulation in thrombi,where ADP is released before thrombin formation.},

abstract = {Hemostasis and pathological thrombus formation are dynamic processes that require multiple adhesive receptor-ligand interactions, with blood platelets at the heart of such events. Many studies have contributed to shed light on the importance of von Willebrand factor (VWF) interaction with its platelet receptors, glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V and $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 integrin, in promoting primary platelet adhesion and aggregation following vessel injury. This review will recapitulate our current knowledge on the subject from the rheological aspect to the spatio-temporal development of thrombus formation. We will also discuss the signaling events generated by VWF/GPIb-IX-V interaction, leading to platelet activation. Additionally, we will review the growing body of evidence gathered from the recent development of pathological mouse models suggesting that VWF binding to GPIb-IX-V is a promising target in arterial and venous pathological thrombosis. Finally, the pathological aspects of VWF and its impact on platelets will be addressed. },

abstract = {Thrombosis is a significant issue for cardiovascular device development and use. While thrombosis models are available, very few are device-related and none have been thoroughly validated experimentally. Here, we introduce a surface adherent platelet transport equation into a continuum model to account for the biomaterial interface/blood interaction. Using a rotating disc system and polyurethane-urea material, we characterize steady and pulsatile flow fields using laser Doppler velocimetry. In vitro measurements of platelet adhesion are used in combination with the LDV data to provide further experimental validation. The rotating disc system is computationally studied using the device-induced thrombosis model with the surface platelet adherent transport equation. The results indicate that the flow field is in excellent agreement to the experimental LDV data and that the platelet adhesion simulations are in good agreement with the in vitro platelet data. These results provide good evidence that this transport equation can be used to express the relationship between blood and a biomaterial if the correct platelet adhesion characteristics are known for the biomaterial. Further validation is necessary with other materials.},

abstract = {$\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 activation in platelets is followed by activation of the tyrosine kinase c-Src associated with the carboxyl-terminus of the $\beta$3 cytosolic tail. Exogenous peptides designed to interact with the $\alpha$IIb TM domain activate single $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 molecules in platelets by binding to the $\alpha$IIb TM domain and causing separation of the $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 TM domain heterodimer. Here, we asked whether directly activating single $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 molecules in platelets using the designed peptide anti-$\alpha$IIb TM also initiates $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-mediated outside-in signaling by causing activation of $\beta$3-associated c-Src. Anti-$\alpha$IIb TM caused activation of $\beta$3-associated c-Src and the kinase Syk, but not the kinase FAK, under conditions that precluded extracellular ligand binding to $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3. c-Src and Syk are activated by trans-autophosphorylation, suggesting that activation of individual $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 molecules can initiate $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 clustering in the absence of ligand binding. Consistent with this possibility, incubating platelets with anti-$\alpha$IIb TM resulted in the re-distribution of $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 from a homogenous ring located at the periphery of discoid platelets into nodular densities consistent with clustered $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3. Thus, these studies indicate that not only is resting $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 poised to undergo a conformational change that exposes its ligand-binding site, but it is poised to rapidly assemble into intracellular signal-generating complexes as well.},

abstract = {The ability of platelets to tether to and translocate on injured vascular endothelium relies on the interaction between the platelet glycoprotein receptor Ib alpha (GPIb(alpha)) and the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (vWF-A1). To date, limited information exists on the kinetics that govern platelet interactions with vWF in hemodynamic flow. We now report that the GPIb(alpha)-vWF-A1 tether bond displays similar kinetic attributes as the selectins including: 1) the requirement for a critical level of hydrodynamic flow to initiate adhesion, 2) short-lived tethering events at sites of vascular injury in vivo, and 3) a fast intrinsic dissociation rate constant, k(0)(off) (3.45 +/- 0.37 s(-1)). Values for k(off), as determined by pause time analysis of transient capture/release events, were also found to vary exponentially (4.2 +/- 0.8 s(-1) to 7.3 +/- 0.4 s(-1)) as a function of the force applied to the bond (from 36 to 217 pN). The biological importance of rapid bond dissociation in platelet adhesion is demonstrated by kinetic characterization of the A1 domain mutation, I546V that is associated with type 2B von Willebrand disease (vWD), a bleeding disorder that is due to the spontaneous binding of plasma vWF to circulating platelets. This mutation resulted in a loss of the shear threshold phenomenon, a approximately sixfold reduction in k(off), but no significant alteration in the ability of the tether bond to resist shear-induced forces. Thus, flow dependent adhesion and rapid and force-dependent kinetic properties are the predominant features of the GPIb(alpha)-vWF-A1 tether bond that in part may explain the preferential binding of platelets to vWF at sites of vascular injury, the lack of spontaneous platelet aggregation in circulating blood, and a mechanism to limit thrombus formation.},

abstract = {The tethering of platelets on the injured vessel surface mediated by glycoprotein Ib$\alpha$ (GPIb$\alpha$) - Von Willebrand factor (vWF) bonds, as well as the interaction between flowing platelets and adherent platelets, are two key events that take place immediately following blood vessel injury. This early-stage platelet deposition and accumulation triggers the initiation of hemostasis, a self-defensive mechanism to prevent the body from excessive blood loss. To understand and predict this complex process, one must integrate experimentally determined information on the mechanics and biochemical kinetics of participating receptors over very small time frames (1-1000. $\mu$s) and length scales (10-100. nm), to collective phenomena occurring over seconds and tens of microns. In the present study, a unique three dimensional multiscale computational model, Platelet Adhesive Dynamics (PAD), was applied to elucidate the unique physics of (i) a non-spherical, disk-shaped platelet interacting and tethering onto the damaged vessel wall followed by (ii) collisional interactions between a flowing platelet with a downstream adherent platelet. By analyzing numerous simulations under different physiological conditions, we conclude that the platelet's unique spheroid-shape provides heterogeneous, orientation-dependent translocation (rolling) behavior which enhances cell-wall interactions. We also conclude that platelet-platelet near field interactions are critical for cell-cell communication during the initiation of microthrombi. The PAD model described here helps to identify the physical factors that control the initial stages of platelet capture during this process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The image system for the method of regularized Stokeslets is developed and implemented. The method uses smooth localized functions to approximate a delta distribution in the derivation of the fluid flow due to a concentrated force. In order to satisfy zero-flow boundary conditions at a plane wall, the method of images derived for a standard (singular) Stokeslet is extended to give exact cancellation of the regularized flow at the wall. As the regularization parameter vanishes, the expressions reduce to the known images for singular Stokeslets. The advantage of the regularized method is that it gives bounded velocity fields even for isolated forces or for distributions of forces along curves. These are useful in the simulation of ciliary beats, flagellar motion, and particle suspensions. The expression relating force and velocity can be inverted to find the forces that generate a given velocity boundary condition. The latter is exemplified by modeling a cilium as a filament moving in a three-dimensional flow. The cilium velocity at various times is constructed from known data and used to determine the force field along the filament. Those forces can then reproduce the flow everywhere. The validity of the method is evaluated by computing the drag on a sphere moving near a wall. Comparisons with known expressions for the drag show that the method gives accurate results for spheres even within a distance from the wall equal to the surface discretization size. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The type-I interferon (IFN-a/b) response is critical to immunity against viruses and can be triggered in many cell types by cytosolic detection of viral infection, or in differentiated plasmacytoid dendritic cells by the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) subfamily, which generates signals via the adaptor MyD88 to elicit robust IFN induction1–4. Using mice deficient in the Irf7 gene (Irf72/2 mice), we show that the transcription factor IRF-7 is essential for the induction of IFN-a/b genes via the virusactivated, MyD88-independent pathway and the TLR-activated, MyD88-dependent pathway. Viral induction of MyD88- independent IFN-a/b genes is severely impaired in Irf72/2 fibroblasts. Consistently, Irf72/2 mice are more vulnerable than Myd882/2 mice to viral infection, and this correlates with a marked decrease in serum IFN levels, indicating the importance of the IRF-7-dependent induction of systemic IFN responses for innate antiviral immunity. Furthermore, robust induction of IFN production by activation of the TLR9 subfamily in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is entirely dependent on IRF-7, and this MyD88–IRF-7 pathway governs the induction of CD81 T-cell responses. Thus, all elements of IFN responses, whether the systemic production of IFN in innate immunity or the local action of IFN from plasmacytoid dendritic cells in adaptive immunity, are under the control of IRF-7.},

abstract = {Mitochondria play an important role in regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in a cell. Here we present a mathematical model of mitochondrial ion transport and use this model to analyse different modes of Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria. The model includes transport of H+, Ca2+, K+, inorganic phosphate and oxidative substrates across the inner mitochondrial membrane harboring permeability transition pore (PTP). The detailed description of ion fluxes is based on the experimental ion kinetics in isolated mitochondria. Using the model we show that the kinetics of Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria is regulated by the total amount of Ca2+ in the system and the rate of Ca2+ infusion. Varying these parameters we find three different modes of ion transport. When the total amount of Ca2+ is below 140 nmol Ca2+/mg protein, all available Ca2+ is accumulated in the matrix without activation of the PTP. Between 140 and 160 nmol Ca2+/mg protein, accumulation of Ca2+ generates periodic opening and closure of the PTP and oscillations of ion fluxes. Higher levels of Ca2+ ({\textgreater}160 nmol Ca2+/mg protein) result in a permanently open PTP, membrane depolarization and loss of small ions from the matrix. We show that in the intermediate range of Ca2+ concentrations the rate of Ca2+ infusion regulates the PTP state, so that slow Ca2+ infusion does not lead to PTP opening, while fast Ca2+ infusion results in an oscillatory state. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Resting platelets maintain a stable level of low cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) and high dense tubular system calcium ([Ca2+]dts). During thrombosis, activators cause a transient rise in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) to trigger calcium mobilization from stores and elevation of [Ca2+]cyt. Another major source of [Ca2+]cyt elevation is store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through plasmalemmal calcium channels that open in response to store depletion as [Ca2+]dts drops. A 34-species systems model employed kinetics describing IP3-receptor, DTS-plasmalemma puncta formation, SOCE via assembly of STIM1 and Orai1, and the plasmalemma and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases. Four constraints were imposed: calcium homeostasis before activation; stable in zero extracellular calcium; IP3-activatable; and functional SOCE. Using a Monte Carlo method to sample three unknown parameters and nine initial concentrations in a 12-dimensional space near measured or expected values, we found that model configurations that were responsive to stimuli and demonstrated significant SOCE required high inner membrane electric potential ({\textgreater}-70 mV) and low resting IP3 concentrations. The absence of puncta in resting cells was required to prevent spontaneous store depletion in calcium-free media. Ten-fold increases in IP3 caused saturated calcium mobilization. This systems model represents a critical step in being able to predict platelets' phenotypes during hemostasis or thrombosis. ?? 2014 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Cell rolling on the vascular endothelium plays an important role in trafficking of leukocytes, stem cells, and cancer cells. We describe a semianalytical model of cell rolling that focuses on the microvillus as the unit of cell-substrate interaction and integrates microvillus mechanics, receptor clustering, force-dependent receptor-ligand kinetics, and cortical tension that enables incorporation of cell body deformation. Using parameters obtained from independent experiments, the model showed excellent agreement with experimental studies of neutrophil rolling on P-selectin and predicted different regimes of cell rolling, including spreading of the cells on the substrate under high shear. The cortical tension affected the cell-surface contact area and influenced the rolling velocity, and modulated the dependence of rolling velocity on microvillus stiffness. Moreover, at the same shear stress, microvilli of cells with higher cortical tension carried a greater load compared to those with lower cortical tension. We also used the model to obtain a scaling dependence of the contact radius and cell rolling velocity under different conditions of shear stress, cortical tension, and ligand density. This model advances theoretical understanding of cell rolling by incorporating cortical tension and microvillus extension into a versatile, semianalytical framework. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Thrombin activates platelets in an ordered sequence of events that includes shape change, increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+), activation of the alphaIIbbeta3 integrin, granule secretion, aggregation, and formation of a stable hemostatic plug. Activation of this process has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, stroke, and thrombosis. There are two identified thrombin-activated receptors on the surface of human platelets. PAR1 is a high-affinity thrombin receptor, and PAR4 is a low apparent affinity thrombin receptor of uncertain function. The goal of these studies is to determine the kinetics of thrombin activation of PAR1 and PAR4 and to relate the individual inputs from each receptor to platelet Ca(2+) signaling, secondary autocrine stimulation, and aggregation. Using a combination of PAR-specific peptide ligands and anti-PAR1 reagents, we separated the biphasic thrombin Ca(2+) response of platelets into two discrete components-a rapid spike response caused by PAR1, followed by a slower prolonged response from PAR4. Despite having a 20-70-fold slower rate of activation, PAR4 produces the majority of the integrated Ca(2+) signal that is sustained by the continuous presence of catalytically active thrombin. Surprisingly, PAR4 activation is much more effective than PAR1 activation in mounting secondary autocrine Ca(2+) signals from secreted ADP. The strong ADP response due to activated PAR4, however, requires prior activation of PAR1 as would normally occur during treatment of platelets with thrombin. Thus, the late signal generated by activated PAR4 is not redundant with the early signal from PAR1 and instead serves to greatly extend the high intracellular Ca(2+) levels that support the late phase of the platelet aggregation process.},

abstract = {Many biomolecular bonds exhibit a mechanical strength that increases in proportion to the logarithm of the rate of force application. Consistent with exponential decrease in bond lifetime under rising force, this kinetically limited failure reflects dissociation along a single thermodynamic pathway impeded by a sharp free energy barrier. Using a sensitive force probe to test the leukocyte adhesion bond P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1)-P-selectin, we observed a linear increase of bond strength with each 10-fold increase in the rate of force application from 300 to 30,000 pN/sec, implying a single pathway for failure. However, the strength and lifetime of PSGL-1-P-selectin bonds dropped anomalously when loaded below 300 pN/sec, demonstrating unexpectedly faster dissociation and a possible second pathway for failure. Remarkably, if first loaded by a "jump" in force to 20-30 pN, the bonds became strong when subjected to a force ramp as slow as 30 pN/sec and exhibited the same single-pathway kinetics under all force rates. Applied in this way, a new "jump/ramp" mode of force spectroscopy was used to show that the PSGL-1-P-selectin bond behaves as a mechanochemical switch where force history selects between two dissociation pathways with markedly different properties. Furthermore, replacing PSGL-1 by variants of its 19-aa N terminus and by the crucial tetrasaccharide sialyl LewisX produces dramatic changes in the failure kinetics, suggesting a structural basis for the two pathways. The two-pathway switch seems to provide a mechanism for the "catch bond" response observed recently with PSGL-1-P-selectin bonds subjected to small-constant forces.},

abstract = {Outside-in integrin alphaIIbbeta3 signaling is required for normal platelet thrombus formation and is triggered by c-Src activation through an unknown mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate an essential role for protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-1B in this process. In resting platelets, c-Src forms a complex with alphaIIbbeta3 and Csk, which phosphorylates c-Src tyrosine 529 to maintain c-Src autoinhibition. Fibrinogen binding to alphaIIbbeta3 triggers PTP-1B recruitment to the alphaIIbbeta3-c-Src-Csk complex in a manner that is dependent on c-Src and specific tyrosine (tyrosine 152 and 153) and proline (proline 309 and 310) residues in PTP-1B. Studies of PTP-1B-deficient mouse platelets indicate that PTP-1B is required for fibrinogen-dependent Csk dissociation from alphaIIbbeta3, dephosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529, and c-Src activation. Furthermore, PTP-1B-deficient platelets are defective in outside-in alphaIIbbeta3 signaling in vitro as manifested by poor spreading on fibrinogen and decreased clot retraction, and they exhibit ineffective Ca2+ signaling and thrombus formation in vivo. Thus, PTP-1B is an essential positive regulator of the initiation of outside-in alphaIIbbeta3 signaling in platelets.},

abstract = {Integrins regulate cell adhesion and motility through tyrosine kinases, but initiation of this process is poorly understood. We find here that Src associates constitutively with integrin alphaIIbbeta3 in platelets. Platelet adhesion to fibrinogen caused a rapid increase in alphaIIbbeta3-associated Src activity, and active Src localized to filopodia and cell edges. Csk, which negatively regulates Src by phosphorylating Tyr-529, was also constitutively associated with alphaIIbbeta3. However, fibrinogen binding caused Csk to dissociate from alphaIIbbeta3, concomitant with dephosphorylation of Src Tyr-529 and phosphorylation of Src activation loop Tyr-418. In contrast to the behavior of Src and Csk, Syk was associated with alphaIIbbeta3 only after fibrinogen binding. Platelets multiply deficient in Src, Hck, Fgr, and Lyn, or normal platelets treated with Src kinase inhibitors failed to spread on fibrinogen. Inhibition of Src kinases blocked Syk activation and inhibited phosphorylation of Syk substrates (Vav1, Vav3, SLP-76) implicated in cytoskeletal regulation. Syk-deficient platelets exhibited Src activation upon adhesion to fibrinogen, but no spreading or phosphorylation of Vav1, Vav3, and SLP-76. These studies establish that platelet spreading on fibrinogen requires sequential activation of Src and Syk in proximity to alphaIIbbeta3, thus providing a paradigm for initiation of integrin signaling to the actin cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {Cellular lamellipodia bind to the matrix and probe its rigidity through forces generated by rearward F-actin transport. Cells respond to matrix rigidity by moving toward more rigid matrices using an unknown mechanism. In spreading and migrating cells we find local periodic contractions of lamellipodia that depend on matrix rigidity, fibronectin binding and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). These contractions leave periodic rows of matrix bound ??3-integrin and paxillin while generating waves of rearward moving actin bound ??-actinin and MLCK. The period between contractions corresponds to the time for F-actin to move across the lamellipodia. Shortening lamellipodial width by activating cofilin decreased this period proportionally. Increasing lamellipodial width by Rac signaling activation increased this period. We propose that an actin bound, contraction-activated signaling complex is transported locally from the tip to the base of the lamellipodium, activating the next contraction/extension cycle.},

abstract = {A robust mathematical model developed from single cell calcium (Ca2+) dynamics has enabled us to predict the consequences of over-expression of endoplasmic reticulum-located chaperones. Model predictions concluded that calreticulin interacts with the lumenal domain of the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-activated ATPase (SERCA) pump, altering pump affinity for Ca2+(K1/2switches from 247 to 431 nM) and hence generating Ca2+oscillations. Expression of calreticulin in the ER generated an average of six transient-decline oscillations during the Ca2+recovery phase, upon exposure to maximal levels of the agonist ATP. In contrast, normal cells produced a single Ca2+transient with few or no oscillations. By conditioning the model to experimental data, parameters for generation and decay of IP3and SERCA pump kinetics were determined. To elucidate the possible source of the oscillatory behavior three possible oscillators, 1) IP3, 2) IP3R, and 3) SERCA pump, were investigated and parameters constrained by experimental data to produce the best candidate. Each of the three oscillators generated very good fits with experimental data. However, converting a normal exponential recovery to a transient-decline oscillator predicted that the SERCA pump is the most likely candidate for calreticulin-meditated Ca2+release, highlighting the role of this chaperone as a signal protein within the endoplasmic reticulum.},

abstract = {The binding of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) to platelet receptor GpIb under high hydrodynamic shear leads to platelet activation and subsequent shear-induced platelet aggregation (SIPA). We quantitatively examined the aspects of fluid flow that regulate platelet activation by subjecting human blood and isolated platelets to well-defined shear conditions in a cone-plate viscometer. We made the following observations. First, Annexin V binding to phosphatidyl serine expressed on activated cells was detectable within 10 seconds of shear application. Second, fluid shear stress rather than shear rate controls platelet activation, and a threshold shear stress of approximately 80 dyn/cm(2) is necessary to induce significant activation. Under these conditions, individual domains of soluble VWF and platelet GpIb are subjected to similar magnitudes of fluid forces on the order of 0.1 pN, whereas GpIb with bound VWF is subjected to 1 pN. Third, cell-cell collisions and time-varying stresses are not essential for platelet activation. Fourth, the mechanism of platelet activation can be resolved in 2 steps based on the contribution of VWF and fluid forces. Fluid shear and VWF are required during the first step, when GpIb-VWF binding likely occurs. Subsequently, high shear forces alone in the absence of VWF in suspension can induce platelet activation. In other experiments, purified VWF was subjected to shear in the viscometer, and VWF morphology was assessed using light scattering. These studies demonstrate, for the first time, the ability of hydrodynamic forces to induce VWF aggregation in suspension. This VWF self-association may be an additional feature involved in controlling cell adhesion rates in circulation.},

abstract = {The arrest of rolling leukocytes on target vascular beds is mediated by specialized leukocyte integrins and their endothelial ligands. In the circulation, these integrins are generally maintained as inactive 'clasped' heterodimers. Encounter by leukocytes of specialized endothelial-presented chemoattractants termed arrest chemokines drive these integrins to undergo force-regulated biochemical conformational changes in response to signals from chemokine-stimulated Gi-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and actin remodeling Rho GTPases. To arrest rolling leukocytes, integrin:ligand bonds must undergo stabilization by several orders of magnitude within quantal submicron contacts that consist of discrete integrin:ligand bonds. We present a unifying three step model for rapid integrin activation by chemokines in the quantal arrest unit, the smallest firm adhesive contact formed by a rolling or a captured leukocyte: integrin extension triggered by talin, integrin headpiece opening driven by surface-immobilized ligand and stabilized by low force, and full heterodimer unclasping requiring integrin tail associations with actin-connected talin and Kindlin-3. Specialized GPCRs and their Gi-protein signaling assemblies drive these and other adaptors to specifically bind integrin cytoplasmic tails possibly in conjunction with de novo actin remodeling, thereby optimizing bi-directional activation of ligand-occupied integrins. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Cell motility proceeds by cycles of edge protrusion, adhesion, and retraction. Whether these functions are coordinated by biochemical or biomechanical processes is unknown. We find that myosin II pulls the rear of the lamellipodial actin network, causing upward bending, edge retraction, and initiation of new adhesion sites. The network then separates from the edge and condenses over the myosin. Protrusion resumes as lamellipodial actin regenerates from the front and extends rearward until it reaches newly assembled myosin, initiating the next cycle. Upward bending, observed by evanescence and electron microscopy, results in ruffle formation when adhesion strength is low. Correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy shows that the regenerating lamellipodium forms a cohesive, separable layer of actin above the lamellum. Thus, actin polymerization periodically builds a mechanical link, the lamellipodium, connecting myosin motors with the initiation of adhesion sites, suggesting that the major functions driving motility are coordinated by a biomechanical process. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Introduction The paradigm of activation induced platelet aggregation has recently been refuted under blood flow conditions with shear rates exceeding 20,000 s- 1. These lead to reversible rolling platelet aggregates, which were dependent on the presence of immobilized and soluble von Willebrand factor. Material and Methods In vitro experiments using direct fluorescence video-microscopy were performed in wall parallel and stagnation point flow chambers with shear rates raised from 20,000 to 50,000 s- 1. Washed blood cell suspension containing recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) was perfused over rVWF or collagen coated surfaces. Results Here we show for the first time with the visualization of rVWF that not only colloid and polymer, i.e. platelets and VWF, form a composite, but that VWF itself is capable of entirely reversible self-assembly. On a collagen surface the platelet-VWF-conglomerates did not roll but VWF nets bound permanently to the collagen fibers and captured and immobilized platelets from the flow. Lowering the shear rate below the threshold of 20,000 s- 1 no longer dissolved these deposits. Ultralarge multimer containing rVWF was most effective compared to normal sized rVWF. The presence of ADAMTS13 limited rolling aggregate and platelet-VWF-conglomerate formation to a time window of 7-8 minutes. Changing wall parallel flow to stagnation point flow halved the required shear rate threshold. Conclusion We conclude that flow dynamics can trigger reversible von Willebrand factor self-assembly and platelet-VWF-conglomerate accrual, which are regulated by ADAMTS13 to a time span needed by coagulation to stabilize it, e.g. in case of vessel injury. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Binding of receptor proteins on circulating platelets to fibrinogen adsorbed on a biomaterial surface is a critical event in the blood-material interactions and surface-induced thrombogenesis. In this work, the interactions between purified platelet membrane integrin GPIIbIIIa (??IIb??3) and fibrinogen on model hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces were characterized by measuring ligand-receptor debonding forces by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Force profiles between AFM probes functionalized with platelet integrins and fibrinogen on these substrates showed multiple rupture events over large distances on both surfaces. On the hydrophobic surface, the rupture length range was 20-200 nm, whereas on the hydrophilic surface, the rupture length range was 20-400 nm. Rupture events in the force curves were found to arise from non-specific protein-protein interactions, mechanical denaturation of fibrinogen domains, as well as the specific ligand-receptor interactions between integrins and fibrinogen. Analysis of the distributions of the debonding forces was used to estimate the strength of single integrin-fibrinogen pair at different loading rates. For loading rates of 10-60 nN/s, the debonding strength of a single integrin-fibrinogen pair was found to be in the range of 50-80 pN and was independent of the underlying substrate. Results suggest that once the active platelet binding epitope in fibrinogen becomes exposed by surface adsorption, binding of the platelet membrane integrin receptor will be similar regardless of the material surface properties. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In transfected fibroblasts, PAR4 triggered substantially more phosphoinositide hydrolysis per activated receptor than PAR1 and was shut off more slowly than PAR1. Shutoff and internalization of PAR1 depends upon phosphorylation of its carboxyl tail upon receptor activation. In contrast to PAR1, phosphorylation of PAR4 was undetectable, and activation-dependent internalization of PAR4 was much slower than that seen for PAR1. Mutation of potential phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl tail of PAR1 enhanced PAR1 signaling, whereas analogous mutations in PAR4 had no effect. Thus PAR4 signaling is shut off less rapidly than PAR1, probably due to differences in receptor phosphorylation. PAR1 and PAR4 also signaled with distinct tempos in platelets. PAR1 triggered a rapid and transient increase in intracellular calcium, whereas PAR4 triggered a more prolonged response. Together, the tempo of these responses accounted for that triggered by thrombin. Thus differences in the rates at which PAR1 and PAR4 are shut off allow thrombin to trigger intracellular signaling with distinct temporal characteristics.},

abstract = {It is now well accepted that protease activated receptor (PAR) 1 and PAR4 have differential roles in platelet activation. PAR4, a low-affinity thrombin receptor in human platelets, participates in sustained platelet activation in a P2Y12-dependent manner; however, the mechanisms are not defined. Our previous studies demonstrated that thrombin induces the association of PAR4 with P2Y12, together with arrestin recruitment to the complex. Here we show that PAR4 and P2Y12 directly interact to coregulate Akt signaling after PAR4 activation. We observed direct and specific interaction of P2Y12 with PAR4 but not PAR1 by bioluminescent resonance energy transfer when the receptors were coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. PAR4-P2Y12 dimerization was promoted by PAR4-AP and inhibited by P2Y12 antagonist. By using sequence comparison of the transmembrane domains of PAR1 and PAR4, we designed a mutant form of PAR4, "PAR4SFT," by replacing LGL194-196 at the base of transmembrane domain 4 with the corresponding aligned PAR1 residues SFT 220-222. PAR4SFT supported only 8.74{\%} of PAR4-P2Y12 interaction, abolishing P2Y12-dependent arrestin recruitment to PAR4 and Akt activation. Nonetheless, PAR4SFT still supported homodimerization with PAR4. PAR4SFT failed to induce a calcium flux when expressed independently; however, coexpression of increasing concentrations of PAR4SFT, together with PAR4 potentiated PAR4-mediated calcium flux, suggested that PAR4 act as homodimers to signal to Gq-coupled calcium responses. In conclusion, PAR4 LGL (194-196) governs agonist-dependent association of PAR4 with P2Y12 and contributes to Gq-coupled calcium responses. PAR4-P2Y12 association supports arrestin-mediated sustained signaling to Akt. Hence, PAR4-P2Y12 dimerization is likely to be important for the PAR4-P2Y12 dependent stabilization of platelet thrombi.},

abstract = {Thrombin activates platelets in an ordered sequence of events that includes shape change, increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+), activation of the alphaIIbbeta3 integrin, granule secretion, aggregation, and formation of a stable hemostatic plug. Activation of this process has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, stroke, and thrombosis. There are two identified thrombin-activated receptors on the surface of human platelets. PAR1 is a high-affinity thrombin receptor, and PAR4 is a low apparent affinity thrombin receptor of uncertain function. The goal of these studies is to determine the kinetics of thrombin activation of PAR1 and PAR4 and to relate the individual inputs from each receptor to platelet Ca(2+) signaling, secondary autocrine stimulation, and aggregation. Using a combination of PAR-specific peptide ligands and anti-PAR1 reagents, we separated the biphasic thrombin Ca(2+) response of platelets into two discrete components-a rapid spike response caused by PAR1, followed by a slower prolonged response from PAR4. Despite having a 20-70-fold slower rate of activation, PAR4 produces the majority of the integrated Ca(2+) signal that is sustained by the continuous presence of catalytically active thrombin. Surprisingly, PAR4 activation is much more effective than PAR1 activation in mounting secondary autocrine Ca(2+) signals from secreted ADP. The strong ADP response due to activated PAR4, however, requires prior activation of PAR1 as would normally occur during treatment of platelets with thrombin. Thus, the late signal generated by activated PAR4 is not redundant with the early signal from PAR1 and instead serves to greatly extend the high intracellular Ca(2+) levels that support the late phase of the platelet aggregation process.},

abstract = {Computer modeling is a powerful tool, giving detailed insights into in vivo biological processes and in vitro experiments. Typically, only some of the data generated by a model, and in a reduced form, can be observed or measured by an experimentalist. Leukocyte rolling—a behavior commonly observed in inflammation—is mediated by a continuous series of molecular bonds between the cell and the substrate that rapidly form and dissociate. Molecular site densities and parameters—such as molecular lengths and reaction rates—have been experimentally measured or estimated from experiments. The leukocytes are viscoelastic bodies studded with viscoelastic microvilli. Some of their viscoelastic properties are accessible to experimental interrogation. This chapter discusses the need for modeling leukocyte rolling, summarizes the history of research in this field, and guides through the development process of a leukocyte rolling model, including model parameters, model cellular, molecular and environmental interaction rules, model algorithm, and model validation. Some rolling models use a direct approach, where key molecules, bonds, and cellular elements are tracked in time and space, whereas others use semianalytic, analytical, or agent-based modeling methods.},

abstract = {Platelets bind to exposed vascular matrix at a wound site through a highly specialized surface receptor, glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex, which recognizes von Willebrand factor (VWF) in the matrix. GPIb-IX-V is a catch bond for it becomes more stable as force is applied to it. After attaching to the wound site, platelets generate cytoskeletal forces to compact and reinforce the hemostatic plug. Here, we evaluated the role of the GPIb-IX-V complex in the transmission of cytoskeletal forces. We used arrays of flexible, silicone nanoposts to measure the contractility of individual platelets on VWF. We found that a significant proportion of cytoskeletal forces were transmitted to VWF through GPIb-IX-V, an unexpected finding given the widely held notion that platelet forces are transmitted exclusively through its integrins. In particular, we found that the interaction between GPIb$\alpha$ and the A1 domain of VWF mediates this force transmission. We also demonstrate that the binding interaction between GPIb$\alpha$ and filamin A is involved in force transmission. Furthermore, our studies suggest that cytoskeletal forces acting through GPIb$\alpha$ are involved in maintaining platelet adhesion when external forces are absent. Thus, the GPIb-IX-V/VWF bond is able to transmit force, and uses this force to strengthen the bond through a catch-bond mechanism. This finding expands our understanding of how platelets attach to sites of vascular injury, describing a new, to the best of our knowledge, mechanism in which the catch bonds of GPIb-IX-V/VWF can be supported by internal forces produced by cytoskeletal tension.},

abstract = {Platelet activation and blood coagulation are complementary, mutually dependent processes in haemostasis and thrombosis. Platelets interact with several coagulation factors, while the coagulation product thrombin is a potent platelet-activating agonist. Activated platelets come in a procoagulant state after a prolonged elevation in cytosolic [Ca2+]i. Such platelets, e.g. when adhering to collagen via glycoprotein VI, expose phosphatidylserine (PS) at their outer surface and produce (PS-exposing) membrane blebs and microvesicles. Inhibition of aminophospholipid translocase and activation of phospholipid scramblase mediate the exposure of PS, whereas calpain-mediated protein cleavage leads to membrane blebbing and vesiculation. Surface-exposed PS strongly propagates the coagulation process by facilitating the assembly and activation of tenase and prothrombinase complexes. Factor IXa and platelet-bound factor Va support these activities. In addition, platelets can support the initiation phase of coagulation by providing binding sites for prothrombin and factor XI. They thereby take over the initiating role of tissue factor and factor VIIa in coagulation activation.},

Each patient is stratified according to risk of developing a cardiovascular thrombotic event and inherent risk of surgical bleeding.

abstract = {Essentials Roles of the two thrombin receptors in platelet signaling are poorly understood. Computational systems biology modeling was used together with continuous flow cytometry. Dual-receptor system has wide-range sensitivity to thrombin and optimal response dynamics. Procoagulant platelet formation is determined by donor-specific activities of the two receptors. SUMMARY: Background Activation of human platelets with thrombin proceeds via two protease-activated receptors (PARs), PAR1 and PAR4, that have identical main intracellular signaling responses. Although there is evidence that they have different cleavage/inactivation kinetics (and some secondary variations in signaling), the reason for such redundancy is not clear. Methods We developed a multicompartmental stochastic computational systems biology model of dual-receptor thrombin signaling in platelets to gain insight into the mechanisms and roles of PAR1 and PAR4 functioning. Experiments employing continuous flow cytometry of washed human platelets were used to validate the model and test its predictions. Activity of PAR receptors in donors was evaluated by mRNA measurement and by polymorphism sequencing. Results Although PAR1 activation produced rapid and short-lived response, signaling via PAR4 developed slowly and propagated in time. Response of the dual-receptor system was both rapid and prolonged in time. Inclusion of PAR1/PAR4 heterodimer formation promoted PAR4 signaling in the medium range of thrombin concentration (about 10 nm), with little contribution at high and low thrombin. Different dynamics and dose-dependence of procoagulant platelet formation in healthy donors was associated with individual variations in PAR1 and PAR4 activities and particularly by the Ala120Thr polymorphism in the F2RL3 gene encoding PAR4. Conclusions The dual-receptor combination is critical to produce a response combining three critical advantages: sensitivity to thrombin concentration, rapid onset and steady propagation; specific features of the protease-activated receptors do not allow combination of all three in a single receptor.},

abstract = {Cell adhesion is mediated by specific receptor-ligand bonds. In several biological systems, increasing flow has been observed to enhance cell adhesion despite the increasing dislodging fluid shear forces. Flow-enhanced cell adhesion includes several aspects: flow augments the initial tethering of flowing cells to a stationary surface, slows the velocity and increases the regularity of rolling cells, and increases the number of rollingly adherent cells. Mechanisms for this intriguing phenomenon may include transport-dependent acceleration of bond formation and force-dependent deceleration of bond dissociation. The former includes three distinct transport modes: sliding of cell bottom on the surface, Brownian motion of the cell, and rotational diffusion of the interacting molecules. The latter involves a recently demonstrated counterintuitive behavior called catch bonds where force prolongs rather than shortens the lifetimes of receptor-ligand bonds. In this article, we summarize our recently published data that used dimensional analysis and mutational analysis to elucidate the above mechanisms for flow-enhanced leukocyte adhesion mediated by L-selectin-ligand interactions.},

abstract = {As platelets aggregate and activate at the site of vascular injury to stem bleeding, they are subjected to a myriad of biochemical and biophysical signals and cues. As clot formation ensues, platelets interact with polymerizing fibrin scaffolds, exposing platelets to a large range of mechanical microenvironments. Here, we show for the first time (to our knowledge) that platelets, which are anucleate cellular fragments, sense microenvironmental mechanical properties, such as substrate stiffness, and transduce those cues into differential biological signals. Specifically, as platelets mechanosense the stiffness of the underlying fibrin/fibrinogen substrate, increasing substrate stiffness leads to increased platelet adhesion and spreading. Importantly, adhesion on stiffer substrates also leads to higher levels of platelet activation, as measured by integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 activation, $\alpha$-granule secretion, and procoagulant activity. Mechanistically, we determined that Rac1 and actomyosin activity mediate substrate stiffness-dependent platelet adhesion, spreading, and activation to different degrees.

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) exist in multiple dynamic states (e.g., ligand-bound, inactive, G protein-coupled) that influence G protein activation and ultimately response generation. In quantitative models of GPCR signaling that incorporate these varied states, parameter values are often uncharacterized or varied over large ranges, making identification of important parameters and signaling outcomes difficult to intuit. Here we identify the ligand- and cell-specific parameters that are important determinants of cell-response behavior in a dynamic model of GPCR signaling using parameter variation and sensitivity analysis. The character of response (i.e., positive/neutral/inverse agonism) is, not surprisingly, significantly influenced by a ligand's ability to bias the receptor into an active conformation. We also find that several cell-specific parameters, including the ratio of active to inactive receptor species, the rate constant for G protein activation, and expression levels of receptors and G proteins also dramatically influence agonism. Expressing either receptor or G protein in numbers several fold above or below endogenous levels may result in system behavior inconsistent with that measured in endogenous systems. Finally, small variations in cell-specific parameters identified by sensitivity analysis as significant determinants of response behavior are found to change ligand-induced responses from positive to negative, a phenomenon termed protean agonism. Our findings offer an explanation for protean agonism reported in beta2--adrenergic and alpha2A-adrenergic receptor systems.},

abstract = {A robust mathematical model developed from single cell calcium (Ca2+) dynamics has enabled us to predict the consequences of over-expression of endoplasmic reticulum-located chaperones. Model predictions concluded that calreticulin interacts with the lumenal domain of the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-activated ATPase (SERCA) pump, altering pump affinity for Ca2+(K1/2switches from 247 to 431 nM) and hence generating Ca2+oscillations. Expression of calreticulin in the ER generated an average of six transient-decline oscillations during the Ca2+recovery phase, upon exposure to maximal levels of the agonist ATP. In contrast, normal cells produced a single Ca2+transient with few or no oscillations. By conditioning the model to experimental data, parameters for generation and decay of IP3and SERCA pump kinetics were determined. To elucidate the possible source of the oscillatory behavior three possible oscillators, 1) IP3, 2) IP3R, and 3) SERCA pump, were investigated and parameters constrained by experimental data to produce the best candidate. Each of the three oscillators generated very good fits with experimental data. However, converting a normal exponential recovery to a transient-decline oscillator predicted that the SERCA pump is the most likely candidate for calreticulin-meditated Ca2+release, highlighting the role of this chaperone as a signal protein within the endoplasmic reticulum.},

abstract = {Recent experimental and theoretical work clarifying the physical chemistry of blood-protein adsorption from aqueous-buffer solution to various kinds of surfaces is reviewed and interpreted within the context of biomaterial applications, especially toward development of cardiovascular biomaterials. The importance of this subject in biomaterials surface science is emphasized by reducing the "protein-adsorption problem" to three core questions that require quantitative answer. An overview of the protein-adsorption literature identifies some of the sources of inconsistency among many investigators participating in more than five decades of focused research. A tutorial on the fundamental biophysical chemistry of protein adsorption sets the stage for a detailed discussion of the kinetics and thermodynamics of protein adsorption, including adsorption competition between two proteins for the same adsorbent immersed in a binary-protein mixture. Both kinetics and steady-state adsorption can be rationalized using a single interpretive paradigm asserting that protein molecules partition from solution into a three-dimensional (3D) interphase separating bulk solution from the physical-adsorbent surface. Adsorbed protein collects in one-or-more adsorbed layers, depending on protein size, solution concentration, and adsorbent surface energy (water wettability). The adsorption process begins with the hydration of an adsorbent surface brought into contact with an aqueous-protein solution. Surface hydration reactions instantaneously form a thin, pseudo-2D interface between the adsorbent and protein solution. Protein molecules rapidly diffuse into this newly formed interface, creating a truly 3D interphase that inflates with arriving proteins and fills to capacity within milliseconds at mg/mL bulk-solution concentrations C B. This inflated interphase subsequently undergoes time-dependent (minutes-to-hours) decrease in volume V I by expulsion of either-or-both interphase water and initially adsorbed protein. Interphase protein concentration C I increases as V I decreases, resulting in slow reduction in interfacial energetics. Steady state is governed by a net partition coefficient P=(C I/C B). In the process of occupying space within the interphase, adsorbing protein molecules must displace an equivalent volume of interphase water. Interphase water is itself associated with surface-bound water through a network of transient hydrogen bonds. Displacement of interphase water thus requires an amount of energy that depends on the adsorbent surface chemistry/energy. This "adsorption-dehydration" step is the significant free energy cost of adsorption that controls the maximum amount of protein that can be adsorbed at steady state to a unit adsorbent surface area (the adsorbent capacity). As adsorbent hydrophilicity increases, adsorbent capacity monotonically decreases because the energetic cost of surface dehydration increases, ultimately leading to no protein adsorption near an adsorbent water wettability (surface energy) characterized by a water contact angle $\theta$→65 °. Consequently, protein does not adsorb (accumulate at interphase concentrations greater than bulk solution) to more hydrophilic adsorbents exhibiting $\theta${\textless}65 °. For adsorbents bearing strong Lewis acid/base chemistry such as ion-exchange resins, protein/surface interactions can be highly favorable, causing protein to adsorb in multilayers in a relatively thick interphase. A straightforward, three-component free energy relationship captures salient features of protein adsorption to all surfaces predicting that the overall free energy of protein adsorption $\Delta$Gadso is a relatively small multiple of thermal energy for any surface chemistry (except perhaps for bioengineered surfaces bearing specific ligands for adsorbing protein) because a surface chemistry that interacts chemically with proteins must also interact with water through hydrogen bonding. In this way, water moderates protein adsorption to any surface by competing with adsorbing protein molecules. This Leading Opinion ends by proposing several changes to the protein-adsorption paradigm that might advance answers to the three core questions that frame the "protein-adsorption problem" that is so fundamental to biomaterials surface science. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

A three-dimensional multiscale computational model - platelet adhesive dynamics - is developed and applied in Part I and Part II articles to elucidate key biophysical aspects of GPIb$\alpha$-von-Willebrand- factor-mediated interplatelet binding that characterizes the onset of shear-induced platelet aggregation. In this article, the hydrodynamic effects of the oblate spheroidal shape of platelets and proximity of a plane wall on the nature of cell-cell collisions are systematically investigated. Physical quantities characterizing the adhesion probabilities between colliding platelet surfaces for the entire range of near-wall encounters between two platelets are obtained for application in platelet adhesive dynamics simulations of platelet aggregation explored in a companion article. The technique for matching simulation predictions of interplatelet binding efficiency to experimentally determined efficiencies is also described. Platelet collision behavior is found to be strikingly different from that of spheres, both close to and far from a bounding wall. Our results convey the significant effects that particle shape and presence of a bounding wall have on the particle trajectories and collision mechanisms, collision characteristics such as collision time and contact area, and collision frequency. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Platelet spreading is critical for hemostatic plug formation and thrombosis. However, the detailed dynamics of platelet spreading as a function of receptor-ligand adhesive interactions has not been thoroughly investigated. Using reflection interference contrast microscopy, we found that both adhesive interactions and PAR4 activation affect the dynamics of platelet membrane contact formation during spreading. The initial growth of close contact area during spreading was controlled by the combination of different immobilized ligands or PAR4 activation on fibrinogen, whereas the growth of the total area of spreading was independent of adhesion type and PAR4 signaling. We found that filopodia extend to their maximal length and then contract over time; and that filopodial protrusion and expansion were affected by PAR4 signaling. Upon PAR4 activation, the integrin $\alpha$ IIb$\beta$ 3 mediated close contact to fibrinogen substrata and led to the formation of ringlike patterns in the platelet contact zone. A systematic study of platelet spreading of GPVI-, $\alpha$ 2-, or $\beta$ 3-deficient platelets on collagen or fibrinogen suggests the integrin $\alpha$ 2 is indispensable for spreading on collagen. The platelet collagen receptors GPVI and $\alpha$ 2 regulate integrin $\alpha$ IIb$\beta$ 3- mediated platelet spreading on fibrinogen. This work elucidates quantitatively how receptor-ligand adhesion and biochemical signals synergistically control platelet spreading. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

Although experiments link activation with the opening of the hinge angle between the betaA and hybrid domains in the ligand-binding headpiece, this hinge is closed in the liganded alpha(v)beta3 integrin crystal structure. We replaced the RGD peptide ligand of this structure with the 10th type III fibronectin module (FnIII10) and discovered through molecular dynamics (MD) equilibrations that when the conformational constraints of the leg domains are lifted, the betaA/hybrid hinge opens spontaneously. Together with additional equilibrations on the same nanosecond timescale in which small structural variations impeded hinge-angle opening, these simulations allowed us to identify the allosteric pathway along which ligand-induced strain propagates via elastic distortions of the alpha1 helix to the betaA/hybrid domain hinge. Finally, we show with steered MD how force accelerates hinge-angle opening along the same allosteric pathway. Together with available experimental data, these predictions provide a novel framework for understanding integrin activation.},

abstract = {Essentials Roles of the two thrombin receptors in platelet signaling are poorly understood. Computational systems biology modeling was used together with continuous flow cytometry. Dual-receptor system has wide-range sensitivity to thrombin and optimal response dynamics. Procoagulant platelet formation is determined by donor-specific activities of the two receptors. SUMMARY: Background Activation of human platelets with thrombin proceeds via two protease-activated receptors (PARs), PAR1 and PAR4, that have identical main intracellular signaling responses. Although there is evidence that they have different cleavage/inactivation kinetics (and some secondary variations in signaling), the reason for such redundancy is not clear. Methods We developed a multicompartmental stochastic computational systems biology model of dual-receptor thrombin signaling in platelets to gain insight into the mechanisms and roles of PAR1 and PAR4 functioning. Experiments employing continuous flow cytometry of washed human platelets were used to validate the model and test its predictions. Activity of PAR receptors in donors was evaluated by mRNA measurement and by polymorphism sequencing. Results Although PAR1 activation produced rapid and short-lived response, signaling via PAR4 developed slowly and propagated in time. Response of the dual-receptor system was both rapid and prolonged in time. Inclusion of PAR1/PAR4 heterodimer formation promoted PAR4 signaling in the medium range of thrombin concentration (about 10 nm), with little contribution at high and low thrombin. Different dynamics and dose-dependence of procoagulant platelet formation in healthy donors was associated with individual variations in PAR1 and PAR4 activities and particularly by the Ala120Thr polymorphism in the F2RL3 gene encoding PAR4. Conclusions The dual-receptor combination is critical to produce a response combining three critical advantages: sensitivity to thrombin concentration, rapid onset and steady propagation; specific features of the protease-activated receptors do not allow combination of all three in a single receptor.},

In the absence of the mPTP regulator cyclophilin D, agonist-initiated mPTP formation and high-level PS exposure were markedly blunted, but cytoplasmic calcium transients were unchanged. Mitochondrial calcium (Ca(2+)(mit)) transients and reactive oxygen species, key regulators of mPTP formation, were examined in strongly stimulated platelets. Increased reactive oxygen species production occurred in strongly stimulated platelets and was dependent on extracellular calcium entry, but not the presence of cyclophilin D. Ca(2+)(mit) increased significantly in strongly stimulated platelets. Abrogation of Ca(2+)(mit) entry, either by inhibition of the Ca(2+)(mit) uniporter or mitochondrial depolarization, prevented mPTP formation and exposure but not platelet aggregation or granule release.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Sustained cytoplasmic calcium levels are necessary, but not sufficient, for high-level PS exposure in response to agonists.

abstract = {The plasma protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) is essential for hemostasis initiation at sites of vascular injury. The platelet-binding A1 domain of VWF is connected to the VWF N-terminally located D'D3 domain through a relatively unstructured amino acid sequence, called here the N-terminal linker. This region has previously been shown to inhibit the binding of VWF to the platelet surface receptor glycoprotein Ib$\alpha$ (GpIb$\alpha$). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory function of the N-terminal linker has not been elucidated. Here, we show that an aspartate at position 1261 is the most critical residue of the N-terminal linker for inhibiting binding of the VWF A1 domain to GpIb$\alpha$ on platelets in blood flow. Through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, mutagenesis, and A1-GpIb$\alpha$ binding experiments, we identified a network of salt bridges between Asp1261and the rest of A1 that lock the N-terminal linker in place such that it reduces binding to GpIb$\alpha$. Mutations aimed at disrupting any of these salt bridges activated binding unless the mutated residue also formed a salt bridge with GpIb$\alpha$, in which case the mutations inhibited the binding. These results show that interactions between charged amino acid residues are important both to directly stabilize the A1-GpIb$\alpha$ complex and to indirectly destabilize the complex through the N-terminal linker.},

abstract = {Bipolar co-ordinates are employed to obtain "exact" solutions of the equations of slow, viscous flow for the steady motion of a solid sphere towards or away from a plane surface of infinite extent. Two cases are considered: (i) the plane surface is rigid and fluid adheres to its surface; (ii) the plane is a free surface on which the tangential stresses vanish. Deformation of the surface in the latter case is neglected. Numerical results are provided for the corrections to Stokes' law necessitated by the presence of the plane boundary at a finite distance from the particle. Application of the results to end-effect correlations in the falling-ball viscometer are discussed.},

abstract = {Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) Ca(2+) transporters pump cytosolic Ca(2+) into the endoplasmic reticulum, maintaining a Ca(2+) gradient that controls vital cell functions ranging from proliferation to death. To meet the physiological demand of the cell, SERCA activity is regulated by adjusting the affinity for Ca(2+) ions. Of all SERCA isoforms, the housekeeping SERCA2b isoform displays the highest Ca(2+) affinity because of a unique C-terminal extension (2b-tail). Here, an extensive structure-function analysis of SERCA2b mutants and SERCA1a2b chimera revealed how the 2b-tail controls Ca(2+) affinity. Its transmembrane (TM) segment (TM11) and luminal extension functionally cooperate and interact with TM7/TM10 and luminal loops of SERCA2b, respectively. This stabilizes the Ca(2+)-bound E1 conformation and alters Ca(2+)-transport kinetics, which provides the rationale for the higher apparent Ca(2+) affinity. Based on our NMR structure of TM11 and guided by mutagenesis results, a structural model was developed for SERCA2b that supports the proposed 2b-tail mechanism and is reminiscent of the interaction between the alpha- and beta-subunits of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase. The 2b-tail interaction site may represent a novel target to increase the Ca(2+) affinity of malfunctioning SERCA2a in the failing heart to improve contractility.},

abstract = {The interaction between platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex and von Willebrand factor (vWF) is the first step of the hemostatic response to vessel injury. In platelet-type von Willebrand disease, two mutations, G233V and M239V, have been described within the Cys209-Cys248 disulfide loop of GPIbalpha that compromise hemostasis by increasing the affinity for vWF. We have earlier shown that converting other residues in this region to valine alters the affinity of GPIbalpha for vWF, with mutations K237V and Q232V, respectively, showing the greatest increase and decrease in affinity. Here, we investigated further the effect of these two mutations on the kinetics of the GPIbalpha interaction with the vWF-A1 domain under dynamic flow conditions. We measured the cellular on- and off-rate constants of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing GPIb-IX complexes containing wild-type or mutant GPIbalpha interacting with vWF-A1-coated surfaces at different shear stresses. We found that the gain-of-function mutant, K237V, rolled very slowly and continuously on vWF-A1 surface while the loss-of-function mutant, Q232V, showed fast, saltatory movement compared to the wild-type (WT). The off-rate constants, calculated based on the analysis of lifetimes of transient tethers formed on surfaces coated with limiting densities of vWF-A1, revealed that the Q232V and K237V dissociated 1.25-fold faster and 2.2-fold slower than the WT. The cellular on-rate constant of WT, measured in terms of tethering frequency, was threefold more and threefold less than Q232V and K237V, respectively. Thus, the gain- and loss-of-function mutations in GPIbalpha affect both the association and dissociation kinetics of the GPIbalpha-vWF-A1 bond. These findings are in contrast to the functionally similar selectin bonds where some of the mutations have been reported to affect only the dissociation rate.},

abstract = {Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of lipid kinases that are activated in response to various stimulants, and they regulate many processes including inflammation; the stress response; gene transcription; and cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. Increasing reports have shown that the PI3Ks and their downstream effector Akt are activated by several platelet receptors that regulate platelet activation and haemostasis. Platelets express two immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif (ITAM) receptors, collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and Fc?? receptor IIA (Fc??RIIA), which are characterized by two YxxL sequences separated by 6-12 amino acids. Activation of an ITAM receptor initiates a reaction cascade via its YxxL sequence in which signaling molecules such as spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), linker for activation of T cells (LAT) and phospholipase C ??2 (PLC??2) become activated, leading to platelet activation. Platelets also express another receptor, C-type lectin 2 (CLEC-2), which has a single YxxL sequence, so it is appropriately called a hemITAM receptor. ITAM receptors and the hemITAM receptor share many signaling features. Here we will summarize our current knowledge about how the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates (hem)ITAM receptor-mediated platelet activation and haemostasis and discuss the possible benefits of targeting PI3K/Akt as an antithrombotic therapy.},

abstract = {Integrin adhesion receptors participate in two-way transfer of information across the plasma membrane. For example, cytoplasmic events, such as activation of protein kinase C, cause an increase in the fibrinogen (Fg) binding affinity of the extracellular domain of integrin a d s (" inside-out signaling "). Conversely, li-gand binding to a d s results in the generation of intra-cellular signals. We used anti-LIBS2, an anti-bs mono-clonal antibody, to understand potential mechanisms of this bidirectional signaling. Anti-LIBSS bound to a I {\&} with low affinity (Kd = 7.4 MM), and mimicked inside-out signaling by promoting Fg binding. The af-finity of anti-LIBS2 binding was increased 20-fold (K d = 326 nM) by addition of an Fg-mimetic synthetic peptide, RGDS. Thus, anti-LIBS2 and ligands (Fg and Fg-mimetic peptides) bind cooperatively to integrin a d s , indicating a functional linkage between the li-gand-binding site and the antibody-binding site. The anti-LIBS2-binding site was mapped by its binding to proteolytic and recombinant fragments of the BS sub-unit. The epitope was located within an 89-residue region immediately adjacent to the transmembrane do-main and 400 residues carboxyl-terminal to the known ligand-binding site(s). Electron microscope images of rotary shadowed ternary complexes of Fg, anti-LIBS2, and a r {\&} revealed that the ligand-binding site and anti-LIBS2 epitope are separated by about 16 nm. This indicates that propagated long distance conformational changes can occur in a d s . Such changes are likely to be involved in the bidirectional signaling function of this integral membrane protein.},

abstract = {The efficacy of platelet adhesion in shear flow is known to be substantially modulated by the physical presence of red blood cells (RBCs). The mechanisms of this regulation remain obscure due to the complicated character of platelet interactions with RBCs and vascular walls. To investigate this problem, we have created a mathematical model that takes into account shear-induced transport of platelets across the flow, platelet expulsion by the RBCs from the near-wall layer of the flow onto the wall, and reversible capture of platelets by the wall and their firm adhesion to it. This model analysis allowed us to obtain, for the first time to our knowledge, an analytical determination of the platelet adhesion rate constant as a function of the wall shear rate, hematocrit, and average sizes of platelets and RBCs. This formula provided a quantitative description of the results of previous in vitro adhesion experiments in perfusion chambers. The results of the simulations suggest that under a wide range of shear rates and hematocrit values, the rate of platelet adhesion from the blood flow is mainly limited by the frequency of their near-wall rebounding collisions with RBCs. This finding reveals the mechanism by which erythrocytes physically control platelet {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Annexin V, a protein with a high affinity and a strict specificity for aminophospholipids at physiologic calcium concentrations, was used to probe platelet activation and the development of procoagulant activity. Platelet secretion was studied in parallel using VH10, a murine monoclonal antibody specific for GMP-140, an alpha-granule membrane glycoprotein. Both proteins were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and platelet activation was assessed by flow cytometry. Microparticles, which are shed from the platelet surface and also support procoagulant activity, were distinguished from platelets according to their associated light scattering signal. The relative ability of different inducers to trigger exposure of the procoagulant surface and microparticle formation was: ionophore A23187 {\textgreater} thrombin plus collagen {\textgreater} collagen {\textgreater} thrombin. The density of aminophospholipid on microparticles was higher than on remnant platelets. Platelet activation by these agonists was accompanied by GMP-140 exposure, both on platelets and microparticles. Here, thrombin was the most efficient agonist. The mechanisms responsible for the above processes were investigated using E-64-d, a specific membrane-permeable inhibitor of Ca(2+)-activated protease (calpain); tetracaine, an activator of calpain; and N-ethylmaleimide and diamide, two sulfhydryl-reactive agents. These agents were added to platelets alone or before stimulation by agonists. Calpain activity was assessed by the hydrolysis of cytoskeletal proteins as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results showed that calpain activity is not essential for aminophospholipid translocation or for secretion. In contrast, although sulfhydryl-reactive agents alone can trigger procoagulant activity, they inhibit microvesicle formation and platelet secretion induced by the above agonists, suggesting that different mechanisms account for these phenomena. The use of annexin V in flow cytometry is a rapid method to assess procoagulant activity in platelets and the loss of phospholipid asymmetry in cell membranes.},

abstract = {Red blood cells (RBCs) demonstrate procoagulant properties in vitro, and elevated hematocrit is associated with reduced bleeding and increased thrombosis risk in humans. These observations suggest RBCs contribute to thrombus formation. However, effects of RBCs on thrombosis are difficult to assess because humans and mice with elevated hematocrit typically have coexisting pathologies. Using an experimental model of elevated hematocrit in healthy mice, we measured effects of hematocrit in 2 in vivo clot formation models. We also assessed thrombin generation, platelet-thrombus interactions, and platelet accumulation in thrombi ex vivo, in vitro,and in silico. Compared with controls, mice with elevated hematocrit (RBCHIGH) formed thrombi at a faster rate and had a shortened vessel occlusion time. Thrombi in control and RBCHIGHmice did not differ in size or fibrin content, and there was no difference in levels of circulating thrombin-antithrombin complexes. In vitro, increasing the hematocrit increased thrombin generation in the absence of platelets; however, this effect was reduced in the presence of platelets. In silico, direct numerical simulations of whole blood predicted elevated hematocrit increases the frequency and duration of interactions between platelets and a thrombus. When human whole blood was perfused over collagen at arterial shear rates, elevating the hematocrit increased the rate of platelet deposition and thrombus growth. These data suggest RBCs promote arterial thrombosis by enhancing platelet accumulation at the site of vessel injury. Maintaining a normal hematocrit may reduce arterial thrombosis risk in humans.},

The average bond lifetimes decreased exponentially with increasing pulling force from ??5 pN to 50 pN, suggesting that in this force range the ??IIb??3-fibrinogen interactions are classical slip bonds.

The receptor, the monoclonal Bear-1 antibody, was either covalently linked to 4.75-$\mu$m aldehyde/sulfate (A/S) latex spheres in a one-step reaction, or physically adsorbed to the 4.63-$\mu$m carboxyl-modified latex spheres used in Part I of this paper. The spheres were suspended in 19{\%} buffered Dextran 40 containing the ligand, the bivalent recombinant protein G (Gamma-Bind G), and observed in the counter-rotating cone and plate Rheoscope. Break-up of doublets, tracked individually under the microscope, as well as in populations of 50-150 particles, was studied over a range of normal force from 20 to 260 pN. In individual particle studies, the fraction of doublets of spheres with covalently linked IgG breaking up in the first 10 rotations, increased from 16{\%} in the low-force to 63{\%} in the high-force range. In population studies, the fraction broken up increased with duration and magnitude of the applied force, and decreased with increasing ligand concentration. Moreover, doublets of physically adsorbed IgG spheres required significantly lower force than doublets of covalently linked IgG spheres for the same degree of break-up, possibly because of surface detachment of IgG molecules rather than rupture of receptor-ligand bonds. Computer simulation, using the Bell stochastic model of break-up and a Poisson distribution for the number of bonds, described in Part I, showed that the parameters of the protein-protein bond differed significantly from those of the carbohydrate-protein bond studied in Part I of this paper, the former being much more responsive to force than the latter.},

abstract = {As platelets aggregate and activate at the site of vascular injury to stem bleeding, they are subjected to a myriad of biochemical and biophysical signals and cues. As clot formation ensues, platelets interact with polymerizing fibrin scaffolds, exposing platelets to a large range of mechanical microenvironments. Here, we show for the first time (to our knowledge) that platelets, which are anucleate cellular fragments, sense microenvironmental mechanical properties, such as substrate stiffness, and transduce those cues into differential biological signals. Specifically, as platelets mechanosense the stiffness of the underlying fibrin/fibrinogen substrate, increasing substrate stiffness leads to increased platelet adhesion and spreading. Importantly, adhesion on stiffer substrates also leads to higher levels of platelet activation, as measured by integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 activation, $\alpha$-granule secretion, and procoagulant activity. Mechanistically, we determined that Rac1 and actomyosin activity mediate substrate stiffness-dependent platelet adhesion, spreading, and activation to different degrees. This capability of platelets to mechanosense microenvironmental cues in a growing thrombus or hemostatic plug and then mechanotransduce those cues into differential levels of platelet adhesion, spreading, and activation provides biophysical insight into the underlying mechanisms of platelet aggregation and platelet activation heterogeneity during thrombus formation.},

As such, a large body of experimental evidence now exists, which places the platelet as a key player in mediating a diverse range of immune, inflammatory, and malignant disease processes. This review outlines the central mechanisms that underpin the nonhemostatic role of platelets and provides a summary of evidence demonstrating a role for platelets in mediating selected inflammatory, immune, and malignant disease processes.},

The effects of the matrix are primarily mediated by integrins, a family of cell surface receptors that attach cells to the matrix and mediate mechanical and chemical signals from it. These signals regulate the activities of cytoplasmic kinases, growth factor receptors, and ion channels and control the organization of the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. Many integrin signals converge on cell cycle regulation, directing cells to live or die, to proliferate, or to exit the cell cycle and differentiate.},

The first step of this process is the capture of flowing platelets by adhesive molecules located at the wounded vessel wall. In this article, we study the transport of fixed blood platelets in a microfluidic channel coated with von Willebrand factor (vWF), a large multimeric protein expressed by endothelial cells in the vicinity of wounds. We measure the number of platelets adsorbed at the channel surface as a function of both time and space. Experimental results are compared with a new transport model. We show that transverse diffusion is an important feature of our model, while the rolling behaviour of the bounded platelets can be neglected.},

abstract = {Introduction The paradigm of activation induced platelet aggregation has recently been refuted under blood flow conditions with shear rates exceeding 20,000 s- 1. These lead to reversible rolling platelet aggregates, which were dependent on the presence of immobilized and soluble von Willebrand factor. Material and Methods In vitro experiments using direct fluorescence video-microscopy were performed in wall parallel and stagnation point flow chambers with shear rates raised from 20,000 to 50,000 s- 1. Washed blood cell suspension containing recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) was perfused over rVWF or collagen coated surfaces. Results Here we show for the first time with the visualization of rVWF that not only colloid and polymer, i.e. platelets and VWF, form a composite, but that VWF itself is capable of entirely reversible self-assembly. On a collagen surface the platelet-VWF-conglomerates did not roll but VWF nets bound permanently to the collagen fibers and captured and immobilized platelets from the flow. Lowering the shear rate below the threshold of 20,000 s- 1 no longer dissolved these deposits. Ultralarge multimer containing rVWF was most effective compared to normal sized rVWF. The presence of ADAMTS13 limited rolling aggregate and platelet-VWF-conglomerate formation to a time window of 7-8 minutes. Changing wall parallel flow to stagnation point flow halved the required shear rate threshold. Conclusion We conclude that flow dynamics can trigger reversible von Willebrand factor self-assembly and platelet-VWF-conglomerate accrual, which are regulated by ADAMTS13 to a time span needed by coagulation to stabilize it, e.g. in case of vessel injury. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Integrins are alphabeta heterodimeric adhesion receptors that relay signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane between the extracellular matrix and cell-surface ligands, and cytoskeletal and signalling effectors. The physical and chemical signals that are controlled by integrins are essential for intercellular communication and underpin all aspects of metazoan existence. To mediate such diverse functions, integrins exhibit structural diversity, flexibility and dynamism. Conformational changes, as opposed to surface expression or clustering, are central to the regulation of receptor function. In recent years, there has been intense interest in determining the three-dimensional structure of integrins, and analysing the shape changes that underpin the interconversion between functional states. Considering the central importance of the integrin signalling nexus, it is perhaps no surprise that obtaining this information has been difficult, and the answers gained so far have been complicated. In this Commentary, we pose some of the key remaining questions that surround integrin structure-function relationships and review the evidence that supports the current models.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Several decades of work by many investigators have elucidated the major signaling pathways responsible for platelet activation. Still to be fully understood is how these pathways are integrated into a single network and how changing conditions within a growing thrombus affect that network. In this review we will consider some of the recent studies that address these issues and describe a model that provides insights into platelet activation as it occurs in vivo.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: Genetic and pharmacologic studies performed in vivo have demonstrated that platelet activation during hemostasis and thrombosis is heterogeneous. Those studies indicate that distinct platelet activation pathways are not merely redundant, but are coordinated in time and space to achieve an optimal response. This coordination is achieved at least in part by the evolving distribution of platelet agonists and changes in solute transport within a hemostatic plug.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: Studies examining the coordination of platelet signaling in time and space continue to increase our understanding of hemostasis and thrombosis. In addition to helping to decipher platelet biology, the results have implications for the understanding of new and existing antiplatelet agents and their potential risks.},

abstract = {Adhesive dynamics (AD) is a method for simulating the dynamic response of biological systems in response to force. Biological bonds are mechanical entities that exert force under strain, and applying forces to biological bonds modulates their rate of dissociation. Since small numbers of events usually control biological interactions, we developed a simple method for sampling probability distributions for the formation or failure of individual bonds. This method allows a simple coupling between force and strain and kinetics, while capturing the stochastic response of biological systems. Biological bonds are dynamically reconfigured in response to applied mechanical stresses, and a detailed spatio-temporal map of molecules and the forces they exert emerges from AD. The shape or motion of materials bearing the molecules is easily calculated from a mechanical energy balance provided the rheology of the material is known. AD was originally used to simulate the dynamics of adhesion of leukocytes under flow, but new advances have allowed the method to be extended to many other applications, including but not limited to the binding of viruses to surface, the clustering of adhesion molecules driven by stiff substrates, and the effect of cell-cell interaction on cell capture and rolling dynamics. The technique has also been applied to applications outside of biology. A particular exciting recent development is the combination of signaling with AD (so-called integrated signaling adhesive dynamics, or ISAD), which allows facile integration of signaling networks with mechanical models of cell adhesion and motility. Potential opportunities in applying AD are summarized.},

Here, I discuss possible mechanisms by which applied forces, cell-generated forces and changes in substrate mechanics could exert changes in cell function through common mechanotransduction machinery. I draw from examples that are primarily focused on the role of adhesions in transducing mechanical forces.

abstract = {Integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) plays a critical role in platelet aggregation, a central response in hemostasis and thrombosis. This function of alpha(IIb)beta(3) depends upon a transition from a resting to an activated state such that it acquires the capacity to bind soluble ligands. Diverse platelet agonists alter the cytoplasmic domain of alpha(IIb)beta(3) and initiate a conformational change that traverses the transmembrane region and ultimately triggers rearrangements in the extracellular domain to permit ligand binding. The membrane-proximal regions of alpha(IIb) and beta(3) cytoplasmic tails, together with the transmembrane segments of the subunits, contact each other to form a complex which restrains the integrin in the resting state. It is unclasping of this complex that induces integrin activation. This clasping/unclasping process is influenced by multiple cytoplasmic tail binding partners. Among them, talin appears to be a critical trigger of alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation, but other binding partners, which function as activators or suppressors, are likely to act as co-regulators of integrin activation.},

While the downstream signaling of platelet-ligand interactions is well-characterized, biophysical cues, such as hydrodynamic forces and mechanical stiffness of the underlying substrate, also mediate these interactions and affect the binding kinetics of platelets to these proteins. Recent studies have observed that, similar to nucleated cells, platelets mechanosense their microenvironment and exhibit dynamic physiologic responses to biophysical cues. This review discusses how platelet mechanosensing is affected by the hydrodynamic forces that dictate vWF-platelet interactions and fibrin polymerization and network formation. The similarities and differences in mechanosensing between platelets and nucleated cells and integrin-mediated platelet mechanosensing on both fibrin(ogen) and collagen are then reviewed. Further studies investigating how platelets interact with the mechanical microenvironment will improve our overall understanding of the hemostatic process.},

abstract = {Binding of fluorescein-labeled coagulation factors IXa, VIII, X, and allophycocyanin-labeled annexin V to thrombin-activated platelets was studied using flow cytometry. Upon activation, two platelet subpopulations were detected, which differed by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the binding of the coagulation factors and by 2-3 orders of magnitude in the binding of annexin V. The percentage of the high-binding platelets increased dose dependently of thrombin concentration. At 100 nm of thrombin, platelets with elevated binding capability constituted approximately 4{\%} of total platelets and were responsible for the binding of approximately 50{\%} of the total bound factor. Binding of factors to the high-binding subpopulation was calcium-dependent and specific as evidenced by experiments in the presence of excess unlabeled factor. The percentage of the high-binding platelets was not affected by echistatin, a potent aggregation inhibitor, confirming that the high-binding platelets were not platelet aggregates. Despite the difference in the coagulation factors binding, the subpopulations were indistinguishable by the expression of general platelet marker CD42b and activation markers PAC1 (an epitope of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) and CD62P (P-selectin). Dual-labeling binding studies involving coagulation factors (IXa, VIII, or X) and annexin V demonstrated that the high-binding platelet subpopulation was identical for all coagulation factors and for annexin V. The high-binding subpopulation had lower mean forward and side scatters compared with the low-binding subpopulation ( approximately 80{\%} and approximately 60{\%}, respectively). In its turn, the high-binding subpopulation was not homogeneous and included two subpopulations with different scatter values. We conclude that activation by thrombin induces the formation of two distinct subpopulations of platelets different in their binding of the components of the intrinsic fX-activating complex, which may have certain physiological or pathological significance.},

We applied light and small angle neutron scattering to study the solution structure of human VWF multimers and protomer. Results suggest that these proteins resemble prolate ellipsoids with radius of gyration (R(g)) of approximately 75 and approximately 30 nm for multimer and protomer, respectively. The ellipsoid dimensions/radii are 175 x 28 nm for multimers and 70 x 9.1 nm for protomers. Substructural repeat domains are evident within multimeric VWF that are indicative of elements of the protomer quarternary structure (16 nm) and individual functional domains (4.5 nm). Amino acids occupy only approximately 2{\%} of the multimer and protomer volume, compared with 98{\%} for serum albumin and 35{\%} for fibrinogen. VWF treatment with guanidine.HCl, which increases VWF susceptibility to proteolysis by ADAMTS-13, causes local structural changes at length scales {\textless}10 nm without altering protein R(g). Treatment of multimer but not protomer VWF with random homobifunctional linker BS(3) prior to reduction of intermonomer disulfide linkages and Western blotting reveals a pattern of dimer and trimer units that indicate the presence of stable intermonomer non-covalent interactions within the multimer. Overall, multimeric VWF appears to be a loosely packed ellipsoidal protein with non-covalent interactions between different monomer units stabilizing its solution structure. Local, and not large scale, changes in multimer conformation are sufficient for ADAMTS-13-mediated proteolysis.},

By contrast, an additional lateral force applied to the $\beta$ subunit to mimic attachment to moving actin filaments stabilizes the open, high-affinity conformation.

abstract = {Wall shear stress in postcapillary venules varies widely within and between tissues and in re-sponse to inflammation and exercise. However, the speed at which leukocytes roll in vivo has been shown to be almost constant within a wide range of wall shear stress, i.e., force on the cell. Similarly, rolling velocities on purified selectins and their ligands in vitro tend to plateau. This may be important to enable rolling leuko-cytes to be exposed uniformly to activating stimuli on endothelium, independent of local hemodynamic con-ditions. Wall shear stress increases the rate of dissocia-tion of individual selectin–ligand tether bonds expo-nentially (1, 4) thereby destabilizing rolling. We find that this is compensated by a shear-dependent increase in the number of bonds per rolling step. We also find an increase in the number of microvillous tethers to the substrate. This explains (a) the lack of firm adhesion through selectins at low shear stress or high ligand den-sity, and (b) the stability of rolling on selectins to wide variation in wall shear stress and ligand density, in con-trast to rolling on antibodies (14). Furthermore, our data successfully predict the threshold wall shear stress below which rolling does not occur. This is a special case of the more general regulation by shear of the number of bonds, in which the number of bonds falls below one.},
